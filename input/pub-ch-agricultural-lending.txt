Agricultural Lending 
Introduction 
 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) Comptroller’s Handbook booklet, 
“Agricultural Lending,” is prepared for use by OCC examiners in connection with their 
examination and supervision of national banks, federal savings associations, and federal 
branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations (collectively, banks). Each bank is 
different and may present specific issues. Accordingly, examiners should apply the 
information in this booklet consistent with each bank’s individual circumstances. When it is 
necessary to distinguish between them, national banks1 and federal savings associations are 
referred to separately. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
The booklet discusses the general risks inherent in agricultural (Ag) lending and describes 
supervisory expectations and regulatory requirements for prudent risk management of this 
lending activity. It includes expanded examination procedures to guide examiners in 
evaluating the effect of Ag lending activities on the risk profile and financial condition of a 
bank. The glossary in appendix E contains definitions of terms used in the booklet or the Ag 
industry. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Overview 
 
Ag lending is a critical business line for many banks, especially those in rural areas. Bank 
credit has played an important role in farm activities throughout U.S. history. Most farms in 
the United States remain family-owned. Financing supplied by banks is essential to many 
individual farm operators and to the development of new Ag technologies and techniques. As 
with all forms of lending, Ag credit presents a unique set of risks. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Each region of the country has unique conditions reflected in the variety of commodities 
produced and marketed. Typically, there is at least some Ag product diversification within a 
region; because of the interrelationships between many farm products and activities, and their 
influence on surrounding communities, however, Ag concentrations represent a key risk for 
many community banks. Moreover, each Ag enterprise presents unique technologies, 
restrictions, and challenges for both the borrower and bank lender. 
 
The traditional role of bank credit in the Ag industry has involved funding seasonal 
production and longer-term investments in land, buildings, equipment, and breeding stock. 
Loan repayment depends primarily on the successful production and marketing of Ag 
products, and secondarily on loan collateral. In some cases, income generated from work 
performed outside the Ag industry (nonfarm income) or work performed for other farms (off-
farm income) may be available. Such income is often devoted to family living expenses, 
however, and may only supplement the borrower’s repayment ability. 
                                                 
1 References to “national banks” throughout this booklet also generally apply to federal branches and agencies 
of foreign banking organizations unless otherwise specified. Refer to 12 USC 3102(b) and the “Federal 
Branches and Agencies Supervision” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook for more information regarding 
applicability of laws, regulations, and guidance to federal branches and agencies.

Agricultural Lending 
Ag lending can be a significant source of bank income but can also be the source of 
significant losses. While a bank cannot control commodity prices or production levels, 
adherence to prudent lending standards may protect certain banks from material loss, even 
when a borrower’s farm operation experiences significant stress. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Business Description 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
Ag products vary widely. Different types of Ag production involve different markets, 
growing cycles, exposure to climate and growing conditions (including weather), perils 
(including fire, flood, infestations, and predation), and infrastructure costs. Banks should 
underwrite, administer, and manage Ag credits commensurate with the risks inherent in the 
type of Ag product. 
 
Major segments of the Ag industry include crop production, Ag real estate, Ag equipment, 
livestock production (such as cow-calf and feedlots), dairy, meatpacking, transportation and 
storage, fertilizer production and distribution, ethanol production, and seed production. 
Banks provide financing for a broad spectrum of Ag products, including grains (such as corn, 
wheat, soybeans, and rice), wine, cotton, dairy, poultry, beef, swine, nuts, fruits, and timber. 
In addition to the variety of products, markets, cycles, and risks that affect farm and ranch 
operations, local, state, and federal programs and restrictions can affect the borrower’s 
repayment capacity. 
 
This booklet provides an overview of fundamental principles that apply to most Ag banks 
and borrowers. The OCC expects the board2 and management to have appropriate knowledge 
of the key risk factors relating to the types of Ag lending specific to the bank. Banks should 
have appropriate and reliable risk management systems in place to effectively govern Ag 
lending. 
 
Agricultural Lending Markets 
 
Repayment of Ag loans depends primarily on the successful planting and harvest of crops (or 
the raising and feeding of livestock) and marketing the harvested commodity (including 
grain, milk, hay, cattle, swine, and poultry). Typically, any illiquid collateral securing the Ag 
loan represents the secondary, rather than the primary, source of repayment. Similarly, loans 
for Ag real estate that is farmed by tenants are dependent on cash flow from tenant rental 
income as the primary source of repayment. 
 
Technological advances have had a dramatic effect on Ag production. As new technologies 
involving fertilization, equipment, irrigation, genetics, and biotechnology have advanced, the 
supply of most Ag commodities has increased. These technological advances have affected 
virtually all sectors of the Ag industry. In many cases, larger farm operations benefit from 
                                                 
2 For purposes of this booklet, the term “board” refers to the board of directors or a designated board committee 
unless otherwise stated.

Agricultural Lending 
economies of scale so they can produce products at a lower per unit cost. Larger farms, 
however, tend to retain more financial leverage and thus more risk. 
 
Changes in consumers’ preferences have increased demand for farm products raised in a 
noncommercial setting, creating niche markets often filled by smaller, independent operators. 
Examples of growth in niche markets include demand for organic foods, specialty crops, 
free-range livestock and poultry, and gluten-free products. Also, demand for certain food 
types can vary because of demographic changes and general public perception. Prices may 
rise or fall based on these changes. Examples include the mad cow disease and avian flu 
concerns in the early 2000s, a long-term decline in pork product demand, and a spike in egg 
demand related to the popularity of high protein/low carbohydrate diets. 
 
The prices of other commodities indirectly influence Ag markets. For example, energy prices 
affect many farmers, because natural gas is a basic component of most inorganic nitrogen 
fertilizers, and gasoline and diesel fuel are used for farm equipment and transportation to 
market. 
 
Banks are competitive in the Ag credit market, but nonbank lenders are increasingly 
competitive for certain types of Ag loans. These nonbank lenders include the following. 
 
• Farm Credit System (FCS): The FCS comprises cooperative institutions regulated by 
the Farm Credit Administration. FCS institutions lend money to farmers through local 
FCS associations. Wholesale lending (to FCS institutions) is shared between the Farm 
Credit System Funding Corporation and the regional farm credit banks. The FCS relies 
exclusively on selling farm credit bonds to fund lending operations. The liability for FCS 
bond underwriting is jointly and severally shared by the farm credit banks and is 
guaranteed by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation. Primarily, financial 
institutions purchase the bonds. FCS lenders traditionally are most competitive in the Ag 
real estate market, because they can issue long-term bonds to offset their interest rate 
exposure on long-term mortgages. Other products include operating loans, intermediate-
term debt for capital purchases, rural home mortgage loans, leases, credit-related life 
insurance, crop insurance, commercial real estate loans, and accounting/income tax 
preparation. 
• Farm Service Agency (FSA): The FSA, formerly known as the Farmers Home 
Administration (FmHA), is the agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) that administers federal Ag lending programs. (Appendix C contains 
descriptions of the federal loan and guarantee programs.) FSA loans are funded from the 
USDA’s budget and from funds repaid by borrowers. The FSA focuses resources on 
serving small, less experienced, and disadvantaged farmers. 
• Life insurance companies: These companies primarily provide farm real estate 
financing to larger Ag enterprises, generally borrowers financing amounts greater than 
$1 million.

Agricultural Lending 
• Captive lenders: Vendors such as equipment manufacturers, seed companies, and 
retailers normally provide limited-purpose vendor financing to enhance market 
penetration for their products. 
• Other lenders: These include parents financing their children’s Ag operations, property 
owners providing self-financing for their tenant farmers, and individuals financing the 
sale of land and other capital assets using a contract for deed or sales contract. 
 
Authority and Limits 
 
National banks and federal savings associations are permitted by statute to engage in Ag 
lending. The authority for national banks is found in 12 USC 24, while the authority for 
federal savings associations is found in 12 USC 1464. 
 
No exposure limit applies regarding a national bank’s Ag lending activities, provided that the 
volume and nature of the Ag lending does not pose unwarranted risk to the bank’s financial 
condition. 
 
Certain exposure limitations apply to federal savings associations, as set forth in 
12 USC 1464(c) and 12 CFR 160.30. Ag loans typically are classified as commercial loans, 
which cannot exceed 20 percent of total assets, provided that amounts in excess of 10 percent 
of assets are small business loans.3 A federal savings association may make Ag loans under 
other authority, however, depending on the circumstances.4 For example, to the extent 
nonresidential real property secures an Ag loan, a federal savings association may make the 
loan under its nonresidential real property loan authority.5 
 
Risks Associated With Agricultural Lending 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
From a supervisory perspective, risk is the potential that events will have an adverse effect on 
a bank’s current or projected financial condition6 and resilience.7 The OCC has defined eight 
categories of risk for bank supervision purposes: credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, 
                                                 
3 12 USC 1464(c)(2)(A): Small business loans include any loan to a small business (defined in 12 CFR 160.3 
and 13 CFR 121) and any loan that does not exceed $2 million and is for commercial, corporate, business, or 
agricultural purposes. See the definitions of “Small Business Loans and Loans to Small Businesses” and “Small 
Business” in 12 CFR 160.3. 
 
4 12 CFR 160.31(a) provides that if a loan is authorized under more than one section of the Home Owners’ 
Loan Act, a federal savings association may designate under which section the loan has been made. Such a loan 
may be apportioned among appropriate categories. 
 
5 12 USC 1464(c)(2)(B) generally limits nonresidential real property loans to 400 percent of the federal savings 
association’s capital. 
 
6 Financial condition includes impacts from diminished capital and liquidity. Capital in this context includes 
potential impacts from losses, reduced earnings, and market value of equity. 
 
7 Resilience recognizes the bank’s ability to withstand periods of stress.

Agricultural Lending 
operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. These categories are not mutually 
exclusive. Any product or service may expose a bank to multiple risks. Risks may also be 
interdependent and positively or negatively correlated. Examiners should be aware of and 
assess this interdependence. Refer to the “Bank Supervision Process” booklet of the 
Comptroller’s Handbook for an expanded discussion of banking risks and their definitions.  
 
Banks offer a variety of products to support agricultural lending that may be either 
commercial, or for personal, family, or household purposes, or for some combination of both. 
The applicable rules can cross various banking business lines and products. For example, 
loans for commercial purposes may be secured by buildings, equipment, and land held by a 
corporate entity. Loans for a family-owned business may be secured by a residence and 
motor vehicle, as well as buildings and equipment used for business purposes. Cash 
management products may include personal and corporate deposits, investments, and funds 
transfers which may be in U.S. or foreign currency. 
 
The risks associated with Ag lending are credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, price, 
compliance, strategic, and reputation. 
 
Credit Risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an 
obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract with the bank or otherwise perform as 
agreed. Management should assess the level of Ag-related credit risk and the adequacy of 
bank capital to withstand potential future market and economic distress. Banks financing Ag 
operations and capital investment assume risk associated with the borrower’s ability to 
successfully plant crops or breed animals, grow or raise the product, harvest finished 
products (such as grains and livestock for slaughter) or partially finished products (such as 
feeder cattle and raw cotton), and deliver products to market. In reviewing a bank’s Ag credit 
risk, it is critical to remember that market conditions are often volatile. Prolonged adverse Ag 
market conditions can increase borrower defaults and significantly impair collateral value, 
negatively affecting a bank’s ability to withstand a sustained market downturn. (Updated in 
version 1.3) 
 
Ag borrowers’ repayment capacities are vulnerable to risks including adverse weather 
conditions, commodity price volatility, diseases, land values, production costs, changing 
government regulations and subsidy programs, changing tax treatment, technological 
changes, labor market shortages, and changes in consumers’ preferences. Many of these risks 
may not be under the borrower’s control; borrowers, however, can use risk management 
plans to mitigate many of these risks. This includes use of diversification strategies (crop or 
product mix), purchased insurance, operations integration, hedging, or contracting strategies. 
 
Production Risk 
 
Banks financing crops or livestock assume the risk associated with the borrower’s ability to 
successfully raise and market the commodity. Adverse weather conditions and other natural 
perils can dramatically affect farmers’ or ranchers’ production and ability to service debt. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risks Associated With Agricultural Lending 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
6 
Agricultural Lending 
Grain farmers can mitigate the risk of losses from natural disasters by obtaining crop 
insurance, and farmers and ranchers can make capital improvements to their land to prevent 
soil erosion and flooding. Farmers may spray their crops with pesticides to prevent insect 
infestations, and ranchers often vaccinate their livestock to prevent diseases. 
 
Production problems may also cause unbudgeted expenses that reduce profitability or even 
result in losses. Unexpected expenses may occur because of increased production or 
harvesting costs caused by inclement weather, higher transportation or fertilization costs 
caused by market disruption, feed shortages, etc. Business cycles longer than one year (e.g., 
vineyards, orchards, and some livestock operations) may increase the risk of unexpected 
expenses. 
 
Market Volatility 
 
Volatile commodity prices present another significant risk for Ag borrowers and Ag lenders. 
Large price fluctuations can occur because of unfavorable weather, domestic and global 
supply and demand changes, and macro changes in political or economic policy. Market 
price volatility and production cost volatility can affect both revenues (output) and expenses 
(input). Because many Ag products are globally traded commodities, currency exchange rate 
volatility may also affect prices. Some Ag products are marketed locally, such as vegetables, 
while other products are primarily marketed on a national basis or are simply more 
competitive domestically due to tariffs, growing conditions, or other influences. Rapid rises 
in interest rates can cause increased capitalization rates, resulting in reduced farmland values. 
All of these factors can present risk to an Ag borrower’s repayment capacity. 
 
Farmers and ranchers can mitigate market risk by using a variety of strategies. These include 
diversifying crop and livestock products, hedging commodities under production, contracting 
(pre-selling) production, and hedging or contracting input commodities. Accurate budgeting 
and financial management play crucial roles in whether such strategies are successful. 
Management should have a sound understanding of the financial effect these strategies have 
on Ag borrowers. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Government Policies and Legal Risks 
 
Changes in government policies can have dramatic effects on Ag producers. Regulations may 
differ between states or even local jurisdictions. Some segments of the Ag industry can 
potentially cause significant pollution, soil damage, or erosion. There are extensive state and 
federal regulations pertaining to access and environmental remediation that apply to many 
Ag operators. Additionally, government restrictions can affect the type of Ag operations that 
are permissible in certain areas. For example, large swine, dairy, cattle feedlot, and poultry 
operations generate significant animal waste. These large Ag operations are often not 
permitted to operate near significant population centers. In addition, nutrient management 
plans are typically needed to limit the amount of animal waste applied to cropland on an 
annual basis. Some Ag producers also face legal and reputation risks from accidents 
involving potential environmental contamination or health concerns, such as E. coli 
outbreaks associated with certain foods. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risks Associated With Agricultural Lending 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
7 
Agricultural Lending 
Government Ag assistance policies are also affected by periodic reforms in legislation. 
Depending on the degree of reliance on government assistance, these changes can have 
varying impact on a borrower’s repayment capacity. For example, the Agricultural Act of 
2014 (“Farm Bill”) eliminated direct payments to Ag producers while continuing crop 
insurance options, rural development programs, and conservation programs. Further, the 
Farm Bill eliminated some tax subsidies for corn ethanol producers. 
 
Limited Purpose Collateral 
 
The limited purpose of some Ag-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral 
may have limited or no other uses to support values when loan repayment problems emerge. 
For example, a broiler barn may have little residual value if a poultry grower loses a 
processing contract. Additionally, commodity prices and land values are highly correlated, 
especially in Ag regions where farmland has no other use. Conversely, regions with multiple 
uses for land may have minimal correlation between land values and commodity prices. 
 
Interest Rate Risk 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising 
from movements in interest rates. Most Ag operating lines that banks finance are either short-
term or variable rate loans, resulting in lower interest rate risk. A bank that provides fixed-
rate financing for extended terms (on farmland, for example) exposes itself to interest rate 
risk to the extent that shorter-term liabilities fund these longer-term loans. To mitigate 
interest rate risk in financing real estate, banks may underwrite these longer-term loans with 
a three- to five-year balloon payment to provide the opportunity for repricing the loans at 
maturity. Additionally, the bank may have increased credit risk exposure in a rising rate 
environment as Ag borrower’s repayment ability is reduced by higher borrowing costs. 
(Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Liquidity Risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from 
an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Ag lending can result in higher liquidity 
risk for banks, especially banks with large Ag credit concentrations. For example, if crop 
losses or unfavorable market conditions result in loan payment deferrals, the bank’s liquidity 
could be strained. In addition, discontinued farm operations and migration to urban areas can 
cause declining deposits, creating longer-term liquidity pressure at some banks. (Updated in 
version 1.3) 
 
Operational Risk 
 
Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or 
adverse external events. There is extensive documentation, inspection, control, and 
monitoring associated with Ag lending. Failure to perform these administrative functions can 
lead to loan collection problems. In addition, improper controls can unnecessarily expose the 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending

Comptroller’s Handbook 
8 
Agricultural Lending 
bank to losses and increased operational risk, particularly if loan collateral is sold out of trust. 
(Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Failing to properly document a loan supported by a government guarantee can result in the 
bank’s inability to collect on the guarantee if needed. This is most often the result of lender 
complacence or inappropriate assumptions about a borrower or collateral. Further, lien 
perfection requirements for Ag collateral can vary depending on property type and legal 
requirements in different areas. If liens are not properly perfected, banks may not be 
protected by collateral when liquidation, repossession, or foreclosure becomes necessary. 
Evidence of collateral lien perfection and timely collateral inspections should be documented 
in the loan file. 
 
Price Risk 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
Price risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from 
changes in the value of either trading portfolios or other obligations that are entered into as 
part of distributing risk. For Ag loans secured by real estate, price risk can occur upon a 
bank’s foreclosure or physical possession of a property, whereby the loan is transferred into 
other real estate owned (OREO). During the holding period, OREO must be carried at the 
lower of cost or fair value (less estimated costs to sell). Declines in real estate prices can 
reduce the amount of proceeds that may be realized upon the property’s disposal.8 
 
Compliance Risk 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising 
from violations of laws or regulations, or from nonconformance with prescribed practices, 
internal bank policies and procedures, or ethical standards. Compared with consumer 
transactions, there are few borrower-focused rules regulating Ag financing. Ag lending is 
subject to Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B) (12 CFR 1002) nondiscrimination 
requirements, however, and may be subject to zoning, environmental protection, and other 
government regulations if real estate serves as collateral. Banks also have obligations arising 
from the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department 
of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. There are also banking regulations that 
govern the bank’s management of risk, which include 
 
• “Lending Limits,” 12 CFR 32 (national banks and federal savings associations). (See 
appendix D.) 
• “Appraisals,” 12 CFR 34, subpart C. (See the “Collateral Valuation” section of this 
booklet.) 
                                                 
8 Refer to the “Other Real Estate Owned” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4

Agricultural Lending 
• “Real Estate Lending Standards,” 12 CFR 34, subpart D (national banks), and 
12 CFR 160.101 (federal savings associations). (See the “Loan Policy and Governance” 
section of this booklet.) 
• “Loans in Areas Having Special Flood Hazards,” 12 CFR 22. (See the “Collateral 
Documentation” section of this booklet.) 
• “Procedures for Monitoring Bank Secrecy Act Compliance,” 12 CFR 21.21. 
 
Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can expose the board and management 
to liability and jeopardize ultimate repayment resulting in supervisory actions and/or 
significant losses. 
 
Strategic Risk 
 
Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from 
adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of 
responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. A sound Ag 
lending program should include risk management systems to identify, measure, monitor, and 
control the bank’s risks. The bank should also have staff with the requisite knowledge and 
expertise to manage the bank’s unique Ag risks. Prudent Ag lending requires specialized 
expertise. Failure to provide effective oversight of Ag activities can increase the bank’s 
strategic risk profile while also negatively affecting interrelated risks, such as credit and 
reputation risks. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Reputation Risk 
 
Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising 
from negative public opinion. Banks with lending activities to borrowers in certain Ag 
enterprises can face increased reputation risk. For example, a bank may finance operations 
generating large amounts of animal waste that could potentially contaminate water sources or 
cause other ecosystem damage. Public perception and potential litigation may cast the bank, 
along with the borrower, as an adversary to be held responsible for environmental cleanup. 
Costs relating to remediation of environmental contamination and potential liabilities may 
exceed the amount of the original loan. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
In addition, the bank can damage its reputation if it reduces the availability of farm credit or 
forecloses on farm collateral. Many Ag lenders do business in small, rural communities. 
Constructively working with borrowers often benefits the bank and the borrower. Lending 
decisions that are not publicly perceived as favorable to the community may have a 
significant effect on the bank’s Ag lending activities. For example, if the bank forecloses on 
a family farm owned for generations, the community may negatively view the bank’s 
foreclosure action even if the action was a prudent business decision. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending

Agricultural Lending 
Risk Management 
 
Each bank should identify, measure, monitor, and control risk by implementing an effective 
risk management system appropriate for the size and complexity of its operations. When 
examiners assess the effectiveness of a bank’s risk management system, they consider the 
bank’s policies, processes, personnel, and control systems. Refer to the “Corporate and Risk 
Governance” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook for an expanded discussion of risk 
management. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Loan Policy and Governance 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
A bank’s loan policy should address Ag lending objectives and risk appetite, including 
acceptable types of Ag loans, portfolio distribution, lending market or territory, and risk 
limits expressed as a percentage of the bank’s capital. The policy should establish guidelines 
and requirements for the structure, reporting lines, and oversight of the Ag lending 
department or program. The Ag lending policy should also establish prudent underwriting 
standards and approval criteria specific to the type of the bank’s lending activities. 
Consideration should be given to financial analysis expectations, advance rates on various 
types of crops or livestock, pricing parameters, loan covenants, and structure expectations. 
Additionally, policies should address Ag credit administration and loan documentation 
standards pertinent to the scope and type(s) of Ag lending, including 
 
• financial documentation and repayment capacity analysis, including updates on outside 
debt. 
• budget or cash flow projection analysis. 
• liquidity monitoring. 
• stress testing. 
• guarantor analysis, when applicable. 
• crop and livestock inspection requirements, including appropriate frequency and timing 
of inspections and valuations. 
• equipment inspections and valuation expectations. 
• expectations for the content and frequency of real estate evaluations and appraisals. 
• title and lien verification. 
• insurance policy requirements. 
• frequency of credit checks. 
 
A bank’s policies and procedures should address risks posed by individual loans as well as 
aggregate Ag portfolio risk. Even when individual Ag loans are prudently underwritten, 
groups of loans that are similarly affected by internal and external market factors may expose 
the bank to a heightened level of risk and warrant increased board and management attention. 
The OCC expects banks with significant credit risk concentrations, including concentrations 
in Ag-related loans, to maintain appropriate capital levels to mitigate the concentration risk. 
There also may be cases in which the potential risk to capital is so severe that reduction of

Agricultural Lending 
the concentration or suspension of Ag loan originations is the most effective risk mitigation 
action. 
 
The lending policy should address expectations for appropriately mitigating loan policy 
exceptions, including the bank’s approval process for each type or size of lending transaction 
as well as expectations for reporting exceptions to the board. Management should review 
policy exceptions individually and in the aggregate. Aggregated exception data can provide a 
more complete picture of credit risk in the portfolio and reveal potential vulnerability in the 
underwriting process or in the policy itself. 
 
The board is responsible for overseeing management’s implementation of control systems to 
monitor compliance with established Ag lending policies. The level of compliance should be 
incorporated into the bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) analysis, capital and 
liquidity planning processes, and the board’s strategic-planning efforts. The bank’s Ag 
lending policies should be updated as needed. Additionally, the bank’s Ag lending policies 
should be reviewed and approved by the board annually. 
 
Bank management should also provide the board an analysis of the risk posed by Ag lending 
activities, as well as risks correlated to the Ag industry and their potential effects on the 
bank’s asset quality, earnings, capital, liquidity, and compliance with laws and regulations. 
 
Staffing 
 
The board, management, and Ag lending staff should possess sufficient technical expertise 
corresponding to the volume and complexity of the bank’s Ag portfolio. Given the general 
decline in farm and rural populations, some Ag-focused community banks have had 
difficulty developing and retaining qualified staff for key positions. As a result, board 
planning for staff retention and management succession is critical. Ag lenders should be 
experienced and sufficient in number to grant and administer credits in accordance with the 
bank’s policy. The depth of experience and expertise within the Ag lending department or 
function should enable continuity during times of change or adversity. Additionally, 
sufficient resources should be allocated to Ag staff development and continuing education. 
(Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Underwriting 
 
Prudent Ag loan underwriting shares many of the same characteristics as commercial lending 
in other industries, including strong emphasis on borrower cash flow and repayment capacity. 
Ag banks should not place undue reliance on collateral and cyclical factors as part of 
underwriting decisions. Along these lines, banks should be sensitive to evidence of 
speculation in Ag land prices or commodities that influence the market. For example, an Ag 
loan approval should be based on a reasonable expectation that operating cash flow will 
provide sufficient repayment, not on the Ag land value. 
 
Comprehensive assessment of the borrower’s creditworthiness and cash flow is critical. A 
successful Ag business should exhibit strong repayment capacity, liquidity, solvency,

Comptroller’s Handbook 
12 
Agricultural Lending 
collateral, profitability, and management performance. Conversely, highly leveraged Ag 
borrowers or borrowers in a weakened financial condition are more vulnerable to rapid or 
extended financial distress. 
 
Ag underwriting criteria should consider the borrower’s experience and track record in 
managing a farming or ranching operation. Because a farmer’s or rancher’s cash flow is often 
seasonal or cyclical, appropriate loan structure is critical to managing credit risk within an 
Ag lending relationship. Banks should thoroughly understand the Ag borrower’s cash flow 
cycles and structure loans accordingly. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
The underwriting process begins with current, accurate, and complete financial information, 
including a reliable budget or cash flow projection. Current borrower information is essential 
to the bank’s ability to evaluate a borrower’s creditworthiness and leverage. Current credit 
information generally is considered to be no more than 12 months old. The bank’s loan 
policy should detail specific requirements for credit information and analysis. 
 
Effective written guidelines should govern the underwriting process and subsequent loan 
administration. Such guidelines should address the following: (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• Thorough evaluation of the borrower’s farming or ranching experience and historical 
performance managing debt obligations. 
• In-depth financial analysis of the borrower and any guarantors. This may include analysis 
of financial statements, income tax returns, cash flow, interim financial statements for 
large farms such as livestock operations, or recent credit bureau reports. 
• Evaluation of budgets and projections for yield, weight gain, production costs, and 
commodity prices. This includes stress testing the budget, developing an understanding 
of critical assumptions, and evaluating the degree of reasonableness and reliability. 
Comparison of prior budgets and financial projections with current budgets and actual 
results should be part of this process. 
• A sensitivity analysis that determines a farm or ranch operation’s ability to withstand risk 
and uncertainty as part of cash flow projection analysis. 
• Structuring loans in accordance with the type of Ag borrowing and the expected source of 
repayment. 
• Maximum advance rates for each type of Ag product. 
• Minimum standards for borrower debt service, net worth, liquidity, and leverage. 
• Maximum loan term, minimum amortization, and pricing expectations. 
• Timely and reliable collateral valuations, including current crop and livestock 
inspections, reliable and well-supported equipment valuations, and independent real 
estate evaluations or appraisals that comply with regulatory requirements. 
• Effective financial and reporting covenants, based on the size and complexity of the farm 
operation. 
• Criteria addressing the borrower’s risk management plans, including risk-mitigating tools 
for insuring crop production and marketing commodities produced by the farm. 
 
Once this information is understood, lenders are equipped to effectively structure the lending 
relationship.

Agricultural Lending 
Loan Structure 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
Lenders should structure loans based on the nature of the borrower’s Ag business and the 
loan purpose. A key consideration for structuring Ag loans is to understand the farmer’s or 
rancher’s operations and the timing of revenue and expenses. An appropriate loan structure 
should be supported by sufficient cash flow from the expected source of repayment. 
Borrower challenges and problems should be anticipated and included in the loan structure. 
 
The loan type and terms should match the loan purpose as well as the likely sources of 
repayment. The terms, amortization period, pricing structure, financial reporting 
requirements, collateral value, and financial covenants should be designed to protect the bank 
from risk of loss for the life of the loan. Proper structuring of farm or ranch relationships 
involves securing the credit facility with collateral. A loan’s structure should also consider 
the need for additional support, including loan guarantees provided by financially responsible 
parties. 
 
Short-term loans: Most loans to finance crop and livestock production are self-liquidating 
from the sale of grain or livestock produced during the operating cycle. The production (or 
growing) cycle should govern the maximum amount of revolving Ag credit available at any 
one time. An operating line of credit is generally secured by the growing crop or livestock. 
The anticipated value of production determines the loan amount and dictates the availability 
of funds. 
 
Typically, a borrower can draw against the line as many times and as often as needed up to a 
predetermined amount for given stages of development. As a general rule, all anticipated 
costs to take a crop from planting to harvest are included in a farmer’s short-term operating 
line. These “input” costs include fuel, labor, fertilizer, seed, land rent, and any other 
operating costs associated with the production cycle. Unanticipated costs may also require 
additional short-term credit to maintain production levels (e.g., poor seed emergence 
resulting from excessive rainfall can require replanting). In such circumstances, the borrower 
comes under increased pressure to generate sufficient cash flow to cover the higher operating 
costs and repay the operating line. Alternatively, the borrower may purposely carry short-
term production credit beyond the current growing cycle to store grain or defer sales in 
anticipation of higher market prices. 
 
For crop and livestock operations with short production cycles, such as grains or feeder 
cattle, the loans may be structured to be annually repaid and renewed. For crops involving 
long growing cycles, such as timber or aquaculture, a level of principal amortization is 
generally required well before maturity. The outstanding balance of the loan should fluctuate 
with the cash needs of the borrower, subject to the availability constraints of established 
financial covenants or other controls within the loan agreement. 
 
Medium-term loans: Medium-term operating loans may be up to three years in length and 
typically involve secured real estate as additional collateral. When financing operating loans 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
14 
Agricultural Lending 
with longer-term structures, it is prudent that the bank obtain updated financial information 
annually and reset the loan terms based on an updated risk analysis. 
 
Long-term loans: More commonly referred to as term loans, this type of debt is normally 
associated with the purchase or development of capital assets, such as real estate, machinery 
and equipment, breeding herds, and orchards. Final maturities vary, depending on the useful 
life of the asset or collateral pledged. Breeding livestock (cattle) are normally amortized over 
three years, machinery and equipment over five to seven years, and real estate up to 30 years. 
The primary source of repayment normally is cash flow from operations, with liquidation of 
collateral viewed only as a contingent, secondary source. 
 
Carryover debt: Carryover debt refers to the portion of an Ag operating line that the 
borrower cannot repay from operating production revenue (for example, from crop, livestock, 
or milk sales). It represents a substitute for investment capital and should be serviced through 
future cash flow, sale of unencumbered assets, or other sources. The presence of significant 
carryover debt heightens repayment risk and may require restructuring the borrower’s overall 
debt exposure to improve collectability. Depending on variables including the borrower’s 
leverage position, projected cash flows, and balance sheet, it may be appropriate to 
restructure carryover debt into amortizing medium-term loans while continuing to finance 
current operations with short-term loans. See the “Risk Rating” section of this booklet for 
more information on carryover debt. 
 
Financial Analysis 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
Lenders should have a thorough understanding of the borrower’s operating environment and 
cash flow through a sufficient financial analysis. Because an Ag borrower’s cash flow is 
vulnerable to a wide range of risks, lenders should have a complete understanding of the 
borrower’s cash flow sensitivity and balance sheet. It is also important for Ag lenders to 
obtain and analyze financial information annually using consistent financial statement dates. 
 
The quality of financial information for Ag operations could vary significantly amongst 
borrowers. In general, Ag borrowers file cash-based income tax returns and prepare self-
prepared and unaudited estimated market value financial statements. Larger operations may 
submit audited, accrual-basis financial statements; farm-related income tax returns, however, 
are filed on a cash basis. The bank should obtain information on the borrower’s and 
guarantor’s repayment capacity and financial condition, including income, liquidity, cash 
flow, contingent liabilities, and other relevant factors. 
 
A global assessment of Ag borrower cash flow and repayment ability is often appropriate and 
necessary. Global cash flow analyses can be complex and often involves integrating cash 
flows from multiple partnership and corporate tax returns, business financial statements, K-1 
tax schedules, and personal tax returns. Adjustments for required and discretionary cash 
flows from all activities should be reflected in the bank’s cash flow analysis. Lenders should 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
15 
Agricultural Lending 
develop an understanding of any actual or contingent liabilities and their potential effect on 
repayment capacity, including outstanding credit card debt and vendor financing. 
 
To assess the borrower’s long-term repayment capacity, the global cash flow assessment 
should focus on recurring cash flows. Nonrecurring capital gains should not be considered a 
reliable repayment source, but ongoing capital gains from the sale of breeding stock may be 
included in the cash flow analysis. The bank’s assessment should also include realistic family 
living expense projections and personal debt payments, property and income taxes, and other 
obligations. 
 
When reviewing a farm or ranch operation’s cash flow, it is important to understand that 
farmers and ranchers have the option of reporting income for tax purposes on either a cash or 
accrual basis. As a result, reported cash flow levels may require further analysis. Lenders 
should strive to obtain and analyze annual financial statements that correspond with the date 
of the borrower’s income tax returns. This provides the bank with reliable information 
pertaining to income and cash flow. Such information is also needed to make accurate 
accrual adjustments to the Ag borrower’s cash-based tax return, providing a more reliable 
estimate of the farmer’s repayment capacity. By using cash accounting, the timing of crop 
sales and purchase of supplies can be used to minimize taxes. For instance, fertilizer can be 
bought at year-end, expensed to the preceding crop, and used in the next tax year. The 
purpose of this treatment is to minimize the effects of losses in bad years by allowing 
expenses to be allocated to good years. 
 
Ideally, inspections and cash flow projection analyses should occur at the same approximate 
time each year, because the value of the assets under production changes throughout the 
growing cycle. For example, a grain farmer who plants in the spring would have cash needs 
to purchase seed and fertilizer early in the season and draw on the line of credit. At this point 
in the growing cycle, there would be little to no development of the grain. As a result, 
comparisons to previous production just before harvest, when the grain has matured, have 
negligible meaning. Consequently, analyses of inspections, budget or cash flow projection 
variance, net worth change, leverage, liquidity, and cash flow should be compared with the 
same periods from prior years. 
 
Sensitivity analysis in the underwriting process should estimate the effect of sustained 
changes in market conditions on the farmer’s or rancher’s repayment ability. As part of the 
underwriting process, lenders should prepare base case and sensitivity analyses on the 
borrower’s cash flow and repayment ability. A base case analysis uses assumption scenarios 
based on current prices and average production levels. A sensitivity case analysis subjects the 
farmer’s or rancher’s production to adverse external factors such as lower production, lower 
market prices, higher operating expenses, or higher interest rates to ascertain the effect on 
loan repayment. In both the base case and the sensitivity case, projections should reflect 
borrowers’ ability to repay debt within a reasonable period without excessively increasing 
leverage. 
 
Growing crops or livestock, machinery and equipment, and real estate are all significant 
assets on a farmer’s or rancher’s balance sheet. The value of farm production is subject to 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
16 
Agricultural Lending 
price volatility and production variability. Equipment is subject to depreciation, especially if 
used excessively or under harsh conditions. Because farming operations are highly capital 
intensive, the Ag lender needs to analyze and assess the borrower’s balance sheet to 
understand how changes in the operating environment or market conditions would affect the 
borrower’s financial condition. Leverage position, liquidity, and access to capital are all 
critical to the borrower’s ability to withstand adversity. 
 
Ag lenders should perform comprehensive, global cash flow analysis, even in the presence of 
significant liquid assets because the borrower or guarantor may need liquidity to meet other 
obligations. While liquid assets may be used to support repayment capacity, they should be 
verified and available to support repayment needs. 
 
If possible, the bank should determine a guarantor’s willingness to service debt and track 
record in honoring previous commitments. Some guarantees may be limited in nature, such 
as covering interest only or partial principal, and may be limited to a specific time frame or 
crop production cycle. 
 
Risk Mitigation 
 
Ag borrowers are subject to fluctuating market prices, extreme weather conditions, and other 
perils that can jeopardize repayment. As a result, various tools are often used to mitigate risk. 
 
Government programs: Various government programs may limit the risk of farming. As an 
example, by entering cropland into the Conservation Reserve Program, farmers contractually 
commit to eliminate crop production on that land. The farmer receives annual payments 
established by bid at the inception of the contract, which typically runs five to 10 years. 
Additionally, when available, federal government price supports for certain crops provide 
commodity price risk mitigation to both the Ag borrower and the bank. 
 
Crop insurance: Borrowers purchase crop insurance to protect themselves against either the 
loss of crops caused by natural disasters such as hail, drought, and floods or the loss of 
revenue caused by declines in prices of Ag commodities. These two general categories of 
crop insurance are called crop yield insurance and crop revenue insurance. 
 
Revenue-based crop insurance policies compensate farmers for shortfalls in crop revenues 
relative to their baseline averages and may also allow for increased payments if harvest 
prices exceed planting season prices. Farmers choose the percentage of historical coverage 
they want, and the insurance guarantees that amount. The farmers are paid if the harvest yield 
or crop prices lead to revenue shortfalls. Additionally, unless farmers choose a harvest price 
exclusion option, their revenue protection targets increase if commodity prices at harvest 
exceed the pre-planting prices. 
 
Premium costs vary depending on the specifics of the coverage. Farmers generally have the 
option to obtain coverage on all or part of their acreage in production. This can be done on an 
enterprise-wide basis or by specific piece of property. 
 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
17 
Agricultural Lending 
Yield-based crop insurance policies pay farmers for a percentage of yield shortfalls relative 
to their average crop history or the average yields in their county. Farmers can select the 
percentage of yield differential they will receive. Unit prices are based on the pre-planting 
price per unit set in futures contracts. 
 
Crop hail insurance is another form of yield insurance available to provide coverage against 
loss to growing crops caused by hail. Depending on the crop insured, a crop hail policy may 
also provide coverage for loss caused by fire, lightning, wind (when accompanied by hail), 
vandalism, or malicious mischief. The crop may also be insured while in transportation sand 
during storage. 
 
Banks should be able to obtain information from borrowers regarding the type of insurance 
selected (i.e., whether yield or revenue), crop pricing options, coverage percentage, and 
whether the borrower is in compliance with the terms of the contract. (Updated in version 
1.3) 
 
Forward contracting: Producers often use contracts with packers or grain buyers to market 
their production. These contracts vary widely and require careful analysis, because the 
contracts sometimes increase risks rather than mitigate them. For example, farmers or grain 
elevators that use substantial forward contracting in areas where yields decline while prices 
increase can be adversely affected in two ways. In a typical year, farmers using forward sales 
or futures contracts to lock in prices before harvest deliver their crops and collect a 
“protected” contract price. If farmers cannot deliver the amount of grain promised in the 
contract, they could be forced to either purchase grain at a price higher than the contract or 
settle the shortfall in cash. Lenders should know which borrowers executed futures or 
forward sales contracts and determine the borrower’s ability to deliver or settle on the 
contracts. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
It is important to evaluate counterparty risk. The counterparty to a farmer’s forward sales 
contract is often the local grain elevator. When an elevator enters into a contract to purchase 
grain from a farmer, the elevator usually offsets that position with a future or forward 
contract to sell an equivalent amount of grain. If the farmer cannot deliver the contracted 
amount or provide cash settlement, the elevator still has to settle its contract in the derivatives 
market. Banks may find that elevator operators are unable to meet their debt service due to 
this issue. Banks that lend to grain elevators should be able to quantify the elevators’ use of 
derivatives and assess the resulting financial risks. 
 
Hedging: Hedging is used to mitigate the effect of market volatility through the buying or 
selling of futures and options contracts—legally binding commitments to sell or buy a 
commodity in the future at a previously determined price. Futures contracts for each type of 
commodity have standardized, non-negotiable features, such as quantity, quality, and time 
and place of delivery. Only the price component of a futures contract is negotiable. Most 
futures contracts do not result in delivery of the physical commodity. Instead, the contract’s 
delivery requirement is offset when the owner of a contract takes an equal and opposite 
position. For example, a projection of record harvests may give a farmer the incentive to sell 
a futures contract to lock in the price at which a farmer can sell a particular commodity at a

Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
18 
Agricultural Lending 
future date. Alternatively, a farmer wishing to protect against rapid price increases in the cost 
of feed may purchase a contract to take future delivery at a predetermined cost. Options can 
be used as an alternative to purchasing futures contracts and do not contain the risk 
associated with margin calls. An option provides the right, but not the obligation, to buy or 
sell a futures contract, at a predetermined price on or before a predetermined expiration date. 
Refer to the “Risk Management of Financial Derivatives” booklet of the Comptroller’s 
Handbook for an expanded discussion of hedging. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Borrowing base certificates and loan covenants: Many farm lenders require protective 
covenants and other affirmative undertakings by the borrower as part of the loan 
underwriting process. Frequently, this includes establishing financial ratios and collateral 
margins that the borrower must maintain during the term of the loan. Such arrangements may 
require the borrower to periodically provide the bank with a completed certificate attesting to 
compliance with collateral margins and other conditions—including financial covenants. 
Lenders should review borrower-prepared compliance certificates for reasonableness and 
accuracy. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
These controls help the bank detect trends and early signs of credit deterioration. For 
example, evidence of declining collateral margins may indicate emerging concerns relating to 
the borrower’s financial capacity and can adversely affect the bank’s collateral protection in 
the event of default. Similarly, lenders should monitor credit lines for significant variances to 
planned expenses. When a borrower requests an advance that significantly exceeds projected 
expenses, lenders should assess the purpose of the advance, evaluate the effect on the 
operation, and determine whether repayment capacity is compromised. This helps ensure that 
funds are advanced only for approved purposes. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Collateral Documentation 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
Complete and accurate lien perfection is crucial to protect the bank’s collateral interest. Ag 
collateral most often consists of chattel (personal property including livestock, crops, or 
equipment) and real estate. The methods for obtaining and perfecting security interests in 
each type of collateral are dictated by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and the real 
estate laws of each state. 
 
• Chattel liens: The model UCC, which provides the process for securing chattel 
collateral, has been adopted with minor variations in all states except Louisiana.9 
Examiners should become familiar with the relevant state’s securitization and perfection 
requirements for the type of collateral reviewed. In general, such requirements include 
obtaining a signed security agreement and filing appropriate documentation with either 
the county or state, depending on the type of collateral perfected. With some types of 
collateral, multiple filings may be necessary to perfect the lien.  
 
                                                 
9 Louisiana’s guidelines for securing chattel are primarily outlined in the state’s civil code, although certain 
portions of the UCC have been adopted. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
19 
Agricultural Lending 
Lien searches should be completed for each loan to assure the lender of its position 
relative to other lenders and to identify other creditors. Management should also have 
processes in place to monitor UCC filings so that they remain current as most UCC 
filings expire within five years and have specific renewal requirements thereafter. The 
bank should also be aware of state-specific laws that offer suppliers or landlords lien 
positions that supersede the bank’s lien position. 
 
Attorneys, title companies, or bank personnel can perform lien searches, and all findings 
should be documented in the loan file. Negative findings need prompt and appropriate 
action and resolution. 
 
Section 1324 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 USC 1631) contains additional 
notification and filing provisions designed to protect purchasers of farm products from 
liens about which they may not be aware. Under this section, the bank may safeguard its 
interest by providing a pre-sale notification of its security interest in the farm products 
directly to the farm product purchasers. This section also permits the bank to protect its 
interest by registering its security interest with the secretary of the state in which the farm 
products were produced, if that state has established a qualified central filing system. 
 
• Real estate mortgages and deeds of trust: When considering real estate as collateral, a 
bank should first determine whether there are any existing liens against the property. As 
with chattel liens, attorneys, title companies, or bank personnel may perform real estate 
lien searches, and all findings should be documented. The bank may also require title 
insurance and name itself as loss payee to protect against possible undisclosed title 
defects. Whether insured or not, the bank should review carefully any exceptions noted in 
the preliminary lien search or title insurance binder. If the exceptions are serious, they 
should be remedied before loan closing to protect the bank’s collateral position and risk 
of loss should default occur. Unpaid taxes deserve particular attention, as they normally 
constitute a prior or superior lien to all others. 
 
In some small Ag communities with relatively stable real estate ownership, banks rely on 
an ownership and encumbrance (O&E) report to determine outstanding liens. Typically, 
in-house or local attorneys prepare these reports, based on periodic reviews of county 
records of real estate transactions. Although this is less costly, it is also a less conclusive 
process than a complete real estate title search. An O&E report may be acceptable in 
certain instances, provided the bank clearly documents and supports its decision to use 
such a report. 
 
If the real estate includes a homestead or other buildings that comprise a significant 
portion of the total collateral value used to underwrite the Ag loan, hazard insurance (fire, 
flood, wind, or hail) should be obtained with the bank named as loss payee. The bank 
should have processes to comply with flood insurance requirements under 12 CFR 22, 
“Loans in Areas Having Special Flood Hazards.” 
 
As with chattel collateral, it is important for banks to maintain current, accurate, and 
properly recorded real estate collateral documents.

Agricultural Lending 
Collateral Valuation 
 
Bank guidelines for collateral should include procedures for determining collateral values. 
 
The current values of all collateral should be established during the underwriting process. 
Thereafter, stored crops and livestock should be reevaluated on a periodic basis, with the 
frequency increasing during periods of price volatility. Real estate, machinery, and 
equipment should be reevaluated whenever market conditions or other information leads the 
lender to believe that the collateral’s original assigned value may have significantly 
decreased. Independently derived values usually provide the most objectivity, but regardless 
of who provides them, the individual should be thoroughly knowledgeable about the type of 
collateral being reviewed. Critical information that should be documented in all collateral 
valuations are (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• identifying details about the collateral (location, age/hours of use, and overall condition). 
• fair market value estimate as of a specific date. 
• source of, or basis for calculating, the value estimate. 
 
Crop and Livestock Valuation 
 
Liquid Ag commodities, such as harvested crops and livestock, may be transported and easily 
purchased or sold. While the liquid nature of this collateral gives banks and Ag borrowers the 
flexibility to quickly raise cash when needed, it can also cause rapid shifts in the bank’s 
collateral position and the borrower’s balance sheet structure. As a result, banks need an 
effective collateral valuation program to monitor and verify crop or livestock collateral 
coverage. 
 
An inspection and reevaluation should be performed by a qualified person other than the 
lending officer responsible for the credit decision. When such a separation of duties is 
impossible or impractical, every effort should be made to periodically reaffirm inspection 
results by independent means. Methods banks have used to accomplish this include 
periodically rotating inspection duties among bank personnel other than the primary lending 
officer, using outside directors as inspectors/reappraisers, and contracting the services of an 
independent third party. Further, a dual inspection process can provide effective controls, 
when feasible. This inspection approach includes a simultaneous inspection by the servicing 
loan officer and another qualified inspector/reappraiser independent of loan production. As 
with any confirmation process, greater credibility is placed on the results of inspections that 
are conducted unannounced. 
 
Short-term production loans require varying degrees of collateral monitoring, in addition to 
financial analysis and initial collateral perfection. This monitoring typically includes periodic 
inspections and reappraisals/evaluations. Depending on the type of collateral and the 
operating cycle, the lender should inspect and reevaluate short-term collateral at least once 
during the term of the loan. Most Ag lenders are aware of the growing conditions in their 
trade areas, which gives them a sense of expected borrower crop conditions.

Comptroller’s Handbook 
21 
Agricultural Lending 
When crops are stored away from the borrower’s premises, the bank should be especially 
careful to confirm the borrower’s rights of ownership and possession. For stored 
commodities, third-party warehouse receipts in the possession of the bank normally provide 
suitable evidence of the collateral. When products are stored in the borrower’s own facilities 
or in other nonbonded facilities, banks should develop policies and procedures governing 
how the inventory will be monitored, verified, and controlled based on the borrower’s risk 
profile. 
 
In assessing the value of cash crops on hand, normal practice is to include all harvested crops 
being held for sale and stored in the farmer’s storage facilities, in an elevator, or elsewhere. 
These harvested crops should be valued using the current market price, unless there is 
documented evidence that the borrower has a firm, contracted price for the crops, in which 
case the contracted price should be used. While valuing crops at the current market price 
generally provides an appropriate current value, current market price may not always be an 
accurate measure for determining the collateral position because of the volatility of some 
commodity prices. It may be appropriate to employ some level of historical averaging while 
also considering current market conditions and future projections. Crops for feeding the 
borrower’s own livestock, and seed intended to be used for the borrower’s own planting, 
should be treated for underwriting purposes as prepaid expenses, not as liquid collateral. 
Alternatively, verified surplus feed or seed may be treated as a liquid asset because it is not 
immediately needed to continue operations. The location, amount, and condition of all 
harvested or “finished” crops should be verified by the lending bank. 
 
Breeding stock normally should be inspected at least annually. Some livestock, such as those 
being fed to market weight or the offspring from reproduction, are under the borrower’s 
control for less than one year. In these cases, the lender should generally inspect and appraise 
the collateral at least once during the period of ownership, if feasible. Management should 
also establish procedures to monitor changes in the collateral. For example, in lieu of 
inspections of larger operations, some banks maintain an in-house running inventory of 
livestock bought and sold, which they compare with the results of the inspection. To prevent 
the spread of livestock diseases, there are strict rules regarding entrance and exit from 
confinement facilities so livestock and poultry raised in these facilities may not be available 
for inspection. In these situations, lending personnel should closely monitor inventory levels 
using inventory-tracking reports and validate operations on an ongoing basis. (Updated in 
version 1.3) 
 
Livestock may be located on the farmer’s or rancher’s premises, at a third-party feedlot, or 
elsewhere (such as leased pastureland, public or private). As with crops, the lender should 
confirm the borrower’s rights of ownership and possession. Values can be obtained from 
numerous sources; trade publications and purchase bills from sale barns are commonly used. 
Because livestock values may vary dramatically, depending on factors such as the animal’s 
age, health, breed, sex, and reproductive capacity, the individuals performing livestock 
inspections should be capable of recognizing these issues, making appropriate adjustments, 
and documenting the results. Lenders should determine the amount owed for feeding and 
housing livestock, as this amount may be subject to an agister’s lien, which is typically a 
priority lien. Lenders should also consider liquidation expenses associated with transporting

Agricultural Lending 
and marketing livestock or grain as part of the collateral valuation process. (Updated in 
version 1.3) 
 
Machinery and Equipment 
 
Non-real estate collateral supporting term debt should be inspected and valued periodically. 
Collateral condition and marketability should be included in the inspection documentation. 
Analysis of equipment condition should include a supported estimate of depreciation in value 
resulting from the amount and type of use. A marketability analysis should consider the local 
supply and demand for similar equipment. Some farm equipment is adaptable to a wide 
variety of uses, which improves marketability by increasing the number of potential buyers in 
the event of collateral liquidation. Conversely, other machinery and equipment may be highly 
specialized or not commonly used in a particular area, and thus not as marketable. A 
common valuation source for used equipment is the Farm Equipment Official Guide. Also, 
local auctioneers and equipment dealers are often reliable sources of information. 
 
Agricultural Real Estate 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
The appraisal or evaluation approaches used for Ag real estate are the same as those 
techniques used to value other types of real estate and are governed by subpart C of 
12 CFR 34. National banks and federal savings associations are also subject to a uniform rule 
on real estate lending documented in subpart D of 12 CFR 34 and 12 CFR 160.101. Ag loans 
secured by real estate must comply with these regulations in applicable situations. The 
“Commercial Real Estate Lending” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook contains 
additional information on real estate lending standards.  
 
Events or economic changes may cause farm and ranch real estate values to fluctuate 
subsequent to the bank’s valuations. When this occurs, prudent risk management may require 
updated collateral valuations. Depending on the borrower’s relative financial strength and the 
bank’s reliance on the underlying collateral, an approximate market value based on 
management’s knowledge of local market conditions may be adequate. If, however, a 
federally related transaction has occurred, the transaction is subject to the applicable 
appraisal regulation.  
 
Credit Administration 
 
Ongoing Monitoring 
 
Ongoing monitoring is a critical component of the vigilance necessary to properly manage 
Ag loans. This involves staying abreast of the borrower’s operations and market events that 
may affect the borrower’s condition. Lenders should regularly monitor crop and livestock 
development and compare it to assumptions provided in the borrower’s budget or cash flow 
projection. When there is significant deviation, a new or updated analysis should be 
considered. Lenders should also assess current market prices and the discount rate in 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
23 
Agricultural Lending 
comparison with prior assumptions. The updated analysis should be documented and should 
consider whether the borrower’s ability to repay debt has deteriorated to a point below the 
bank’s underwriting standards. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
The quality of financial information and subsequent analysis is an integral part of any Ag 
credit. This analysis should include 
 
• determining the adequacy of cash flow to service debt. 
• determining compliance with any financial covenants contained in the loan agreement. 
• reviewing the reasonableness of budget assumptions and projections. 
• comparing projections with actual results. 
• assessing and documenting crop or livestock development. 
• determining the effect of crop or livestock perils from weather, disease, or pests. 
• analyzing net worth and leverage changes. 
• updating changes in collateral value. 
• assessing the effect of capital expenses. 
 
Sensitivity analysis in the underwriting process should estimate the effect of changes to the 
borrower’s primary and secondary repayment ability. Updates to both the base case and 
sensitivity case analyses should be performed at least annually. As in the underwriting 
sensitivity analysis, loan repayment should fall within the standards set by the bank’s loan 
policy. 
 
Exception Monitoring 
 
Similar to other types of lending, a bank should have a system to monitor Ag loans that 
involve more liberal underwriting than the lending policy or practices would normally 
permit. The bank should also have a process to identify, approve, document, and monitor 
these exceptions. Additionally, management should track exceptions, such as deterioration in 
repayment capacity or collateral values, on an ongoing basis. To gain the maximum benefit 
from such a process, management information systems (MIS) should provide data not only 
on individual exceptions, but the aggregate portfolio as well. Such aggregated data can 
provide a more complete picture of risk in the portfolio and reveal weaknesses in the 
underwriting process, or in the policy itself, that may need to be addressed. (Updated in 
version 1.3) 
 
Concentrations 
 
Management should consider the potential effect on earnings and capital and on the bank’s 
operating strategy from Ag lending under stressed market or economic conditions. When a 
pool of Ag loans is sensitive to the same economic, financial, or business development 
factors, the entire pool may perform as if it were a single, large exposure when those factors 
change. History shows that concentrations in Ag loans coupled with depressed markets can 
contribute to significant credit losses even where underwriting practices are strong. It is 
important that risk management practices be commensurate with the bank’s risk profile and 
continue to evolve with increasing Ag credit concentrations. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Management 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
24 
Agricultural Lending 
Banks are encouraged to stratify their Ag portfolios into segments that reflect common 
sensitivities for purposes of identifying concentrations. For example, the bank may segment 
its Ag portfolio by collateral type, geographic market, crop or livestock type, dryland or 
irrigated farming, whether operated by tenant or owner, and risk rating. Other useful 
stratifications may include loan structure, loan purpose, loan-to-value, debt service coverage, 
policy exceptions on newly underwritten credit facilities, and affiliated loans. Because of 
correlations among Ag-related risk factors, stress testing can be an important part of the 
bank’s risk management process. Further guidance is contained in the “Concentrations of 
Credit” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook. 
 
Environmental Issues 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
Environmental contamination may negatively affect the value of real property collateral as 
well as create potential liability for a bank under various environmental laws. Ag loans 
secured by real property may expose the bank to environmentally related risks. Additionally, 
some Ag industries are more highly regulated for environmental contamination (see the 
“Compliance” and “Reputation Risk” sections of this booklet for details and examples). 
Therefore, the bank’s Ag loan policy should establish a program for assessing the potential 
adverse effect of environmental contamination and include appropriate controls to limit the 
bank’s exposure to environmental liability associated with real estate collateral. 
 
If determined to be a responsible party or owner of repossessed property after foreclosure, 
the bank may be held financially responsible for environmental remediation under provisions 
of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(42 USC 9601 et seq.). Further, significant environmental disasters can severely increase 
reputation risk for responsible parties—including a bank financing Ag lending. As a result, 
potential liabilities can greatly exceed the amount of the original loan. Lending personnel 
should perform appropriate due diligence to understand and evaluate any existing 
environmental issues and potential environmental risks. Both the borrower’s operations and 
loan collateral should be considered in this analysis. 
 
Audit and Loan Review Functions 
 
(Section updated in version 1.3) 
 
The board should establish audit and loan review functions that are independent of Ag loan 
production, approval, and credit administration functions. Further, the compensation program 
for auditors and loan review personnel should not include incentives for Ag loan volume 
generated by the lending department. 
 
Loan review is a critical control function. Periodic objective reviews of the Ag portfolio 
provide an assessment of credit risk and risk management processes. Loan review should be 
effective in identifying risk management weaknesses, and provide the board and management 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Rating Agricultural Loans 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
25 
Agricultural Lending 
with sufficient information to address concerns as they emerge. Weaknesses in the loan 
review process may hamper the entire portfolio management process. 
 
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
 
Ag loans with similar characteristics should be segmented in the bank’s ALLL analysis when 
there is a significant concentration. For example, the market conditions and factors that affect 
crop loans differ somewhat from those that affect livestock loans. Both of these portfolios 
lend themselves to treatment as separate pools in the ALLL analysis. When changes or 
adverse conditions (such as poor weather conditions) pose additional risks, management 
should consider adjusting historical loss rates to maintain a sufficient ALLL. In addition, the 
ALLL analysis should consider the level and risk associated with any carryover debt. Further 
guidance is contained in the “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” booklet of the 
Comptroller’s Handbook. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Risk Rating Agricultural Loans 
 
As with other types of loans, Ag loans that are adequately protected by the current sound 
worth and debt service capacity of the borrower, guarantor, and underlying collateral 
generally should not be classified. Portions of loans guaranteed by the U.S. government or its 
agencies should be rated pass, provided all documentation and servicing conditions set forth 
in the guarantees are met. Additionally, loans to sound borrowers that are refinanced or 
renewed in accordance with prudent underwriting standards should not be classified unless 
well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize repayment. The bank should not be criticized 
for continuing to carry loans with weaknesses that resulted in classification or criticism so 
long as there is an effective workout plan in place for such borrowers and effective controls 
exist to manage the volume of such loans. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
When loan restructurings are not supported by adequate analysis and documentation, 
however, examiners are expected to exercise reasonable judgment in reviewing and 
determining loan classifications until bank management is able to provide information to 
support its conclusions and credit risk ratings. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
When evaluating Ag loans for possible classification, examiners should apply the uniform 
classification definitions found in the “Rating Credit Risk” booklet of the Comptroller’s 
Handbook. To determine the appropriate risk rating, examiners should consider all 
information relevant to evaluating the prospects that the loan will be repaid. This includes 
information on the borrower’s creditworthiness, the value of (and cash flow provided by) all 
collateral supporting the loan, and any support provided by financially responsible 
guarantors. 
 
There are no mandatory rules to direct examiners how to treat Ag credit. Instead, each 
lending relationship should be analyzed to determine how its individual characteristics 
compare with the following key criteria: 
 
• Borrower’s financial condition, e.g., liquidity, leverage, cash flow, and free assets. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Rating Agricultural Loans 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
26 
Agricultural Lending 
• Whether the loan is performing according to reasonable repayment terms. 
• Whether collateral is sufficiently liquid, valuable, and controlled to fully protect the loan 
if the borrower defaults. (Consider the cost of liquidating collateral.) 
• Borrower’s historical farming and borrowing performance. 
• Other strengths (e.g., crop insurance, significant guarantors, or family support) not 
previously mentioned that mitigate loan criticism. 
 
Although none of these criteria individually determines the appropriate supervisory treatment 
of any farm loan, positive determinations to most or all of them would indicate a likelihood 
that the loan should be passed by examiners. Conversely, negative determinations to most or 
all would indicate an increased likelihood that the loan deserves some degree of criticism. 
 
The following guidelines for classifying a troubled Ag loan apply when repayment of the 
debt will be provided solely by the underlying collateral and there are no other available and 
reliable sources of repayment: 
 
• As a general principle, any portion of the loan balance that exceeds the value of the 
collateral and can clearly be identified as uncollectible should be classified loss. 
• The portion of the loan balance that exceeds the value of the collateral should be 
classified doubtful when the potential for full loss may be mitigated by the outcome of 
certain pending events, or when loss is expected but the amount of the loss cannot be 
reasonably determined. 
• The portion of the loan balance that is adequately secured by the value of the collateral 
should generally be classified no worse than substandard. 
 
Crop Production Loans 
 
Perhaps the most volatile form of Ag lending is short-term production credit. Normally, 
production loans are self-liquidating, with repayment of the loan occurring shortly after 
harvest from sale of the crop. When a bank has a reasonable process to analyze projected 
cash flow, and the projected cash flow indicates the borrower has the ability to repay the 
operating loan, the current year operating notes are normally rated pass. 
 
When operations have deteriorated and it becomes apparent that the current operating cycle 
will not result in sufficient production to cover the bank’s operating loans, the decision to 
classify the loan and the severity of classification should begin with a review of the primary 
collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, and any other sources of repayment. 
 
The amount of collateral represented by cash crops being held for future sale is considered 
liquid if the value is properly documented with a current market price, the lien is perfected, 
and the location is verified. Any loans, or portions of loans, covered by this collateral are 
rated pass. 
 
The proper classification for any portion not covered by liquid collateral depends on the 
borrower’s repayment capacity and the value of any other collateral.

Introduction > Risk Rating Agricultural Loans 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
27 
Agricultural Lending 
Carryover Debt 
 
By its nature, carryover debt suggests a well-defined credit weakness; it is important, 
however, for the bank to understand which part of an operating line is true carryover debt. 
Examiners should not automatically classify carryover debt and should consider all relevant 
information to evaluate repayment capacity and arrive at an accurate risk rating. Some factors 
may lead a farmer to not pay off operating lines and still not result in carryover debt. For 
example, a farmer who has a strong crop year may delay crop sales or prepay expenses to 
reduce income tax liability. While a balance may be left on the operating line at renewal, this 
would not be an indication of carryover debt. Examiners should consider the following 
factors when analyzing carryover debt: (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• The size of the carryover debt in relation to the size of the borrower’s operation. 
• Whether the borrower can amortize the carryover debt within a realistic time frame while 
reasonably servicing all other debt obligations. 
• The borrower’s historical cash flow, liquidity, and leverage, to assess the ability to absorb 
carryover debt and the potential for reasonable debt restructuring. 
 
Management should have processes in place to determine whether a farm borrower has 
carryover debt for the current crop year. A best practice is to segregate operating notes by 
crop year and not comingle operating proceeds between the different growing seasons. If 
loan proceeds are comingled for more than one crop year, management should be able to 
document the operating proceeds for each year to support management’s risk ratings and 
repayment analysis. 
 
When collateral does not cover carryover debt and repayment capacity is not evidenced, the 
carryover balance should be classified and the examiner needs to determine whether a loss 
rating is appropriate. 
 
Livestock Loans 
 
Loans to feeder livestock operations are expected to be self-liquidating. If a feeder operation 
deteriorates and the loans warrant classification, the portion of the loans covered by the 
liquidation value of the feeders should be rated pass if there is a current, on-site livestock 
inspection report detailing the number of livestock, weight, and current market value. 
Because livestock values can be volatile and the movement of livestock is relatively easy, the 
frequency of independent inspections should increase commensurate with the severity of the 
borrower’s financial problems to protect against fraud. 
 
Risk rating loans for financing breeding livestock or dairy cattle is similar to that of feeder 
loans. Although the primary source of repayment for such loans is the successful 
reproduction of the livestock or milk sales, the underlying liquidation value of the breeding 
or dairy livestock provides the same type of readily marketable, liquid collateral support as 
for feeder livestock. 
 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Rating Agricultural Loans 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
28 
Agricultural Lending 
As with crop loans, secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral, may limit 
the severity of any classified portion. 
 
Equipment Loans 
 
Loans to finance machinery and equipment are capital debt. Equipment loans should be 
supported and serviced from profitable operations, including any rental income derived from 
the equipment. These loans should be structured such that repayment is commensurate with 
the useful life of the equipment. If the debt is paying as agreed, according to a reasonable 
repayment program, and the source of repayment is generated through profitable operations, 
the debt would usually be rated pass. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Additional investigation is warranted when equipment loans are being paid with advances on 
short-term operating loans when operations are not sufficiently profitable. In these situations, 
a thorough analysis of repayment capacity is required, and the debt should be considered for 
classification. 
 
When classifying collateral-dependent equipment loans, it is important to have current, 
documented values for all pieces of equipment, including the date and source of valuation. 
Independent appraisals are preferable, but values provided by management are acceptable if 
sufficiently documented. If the collateral values support outstanding balances, a substandard 
classification is normally appropriate. 
 
If the value of the collateral does not fully protect the debt, a loss classification should be 
considered for the residual balance unless the debtor has the ability to provide additional 
security or an alternate source of repayment. 
 
Nonaccrual Status 
 
(Section updated in version 1.2) 
 
Banks should follow the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s “Instructions 
for Preparation of Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income” (call report instructions) 
when determining the accrual status for agricultural loans. As a general rule, banks shall not 
accrue interest, amortize deferred net loan fees or costs, or accrete discount on any asset if 
 
• the asset is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition 
of the borrower, 
• payment in full of principal or interest is not expected, or 
 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Introduction > Risk Rating Agricultural Loans 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
29 
Agricultural Lending 
• principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the asset is 
both well secured and in the process of collection.10 
 
The call report instructions provide one exception to the general rule for commercial loans:11 
 
Purchased credit-impaired loans need not be placed in nonaccrual status when the 
criteria for accrual of income under the interest method are met, regardless of whether 
the loans had been maintained in nonaccrual status by the seller.12 
 
As a general rule, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when 
 
• none of its principal and interest is due and unpaid and the bank expects repayment of the 
remaining contractual principal and interest, or 
• it otherwise becomes well secured and is in the process of collection. 
 
The OCC’s Bank Accounting Advisory Series and the “Rating Credit Risk” booklet provide 
more information for the recognition of nonaccrual loans, including the appropriate treatment 
of cash payments for loans on nonaccrual. 
 
                                                 
10 An asset is “well secured” if it is secured (1) by collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or 
personal property, including securities, that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including 
accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a financially responsible party. An asset is “in the process of 
collection” if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including 
judgment enforcement procedures, or, (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving 
legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current 
status in the near future. 
 
11 For more information, refer to the “Nonaccrual Status” entry in the “Glossary” section of the call report 
instructions. This entry describes the general rule for the accrual of interest, as well as the exception for 
commercial loans. The entry also describes criteria for returning a nonaccrual loan to accrual status.

Examination Procedures 
 
This booklet contains expanded procedures for examining specialized activities or specific 
products or services that warrant extra attention beyond the core assessment contained in the 
“Community Bank Supervision,” “Federal Branches and Agencies Supervision,” and “Large 
Bank Supervision” booklets of the Comptroller’s Handbook. Examiners determine which 
expanded procedures to use, if any, during examination planning or after drawing 
preliminary conclusions during the core assessment. 
 
Scope 
 
These procedures are designed to help examiners tailor the examination to each bank and 
determine the scope of the Ag lending examination. This determination should consider work 
performed by internal and external auditors and other independent risk control functions and 
by other examiners on related areas. Examiners need to perform only those objectives and 
steps that are relevant to the scope of the examination as determined by the following 
objective. Seldom will every objective or step of the expanded procedures be necessary. 
 
Objective: To determine the scope of the examination of Ag lending and identify examination 
objectives and activities necessary to meet the needs of the supervisory strategy for the bank. 
 
1. Review the following sources of information and note any previously identified problems 
related to Ag lending that require follow-up: 
 
• Supervisory strategy. 
• Examiner-in-charge’s (EIC) scope memorandum. 
• OCC’s supervisory information system. (Updated in version 1.3) 
• Previous reports of examination (ROE) and work papers. 
• Loan review reports and work papers. 
• Internal and external audit reports and work papers. 
• Bank management’s responses to previous ROEs, loan review reports, and audit 
reports. 
• Bank correspondence pertaining to Ag lending. 
• Customer complaints and litigation. Examiners should review customer complaint 
data from the OCC’s Customer Assistance Group, the bank, and the Bureau of 
Consumer Financial Protection (when applicable). When possible, examiners should 
review and leverage complaint analysis already performed during the supervisory 
cycle to avoid duplication of effort. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
2. Obtain the results of reports such as the Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) and 
Canary. Identify any concerns, trends, or changes involving Ag lending since the last 
examination. Examiners should be alert to growth rates, changes in portfolio 
composition, loan yields, and other factors that may affect credit risk.

3. Obtain and review policies, procedures, and reports bank management uses to supervise 
Ag lending, including internal risk assessments. Consider the following: 
 
• Portfolio strategies, risk appetite, and risk management guidelines. 
• Loan trial balance, past-due accounts, and loans in nonaccrual status. 
• Loan commitment and pipeline reports showing commitments and undisbursed funds. 
• Internal loan review reports. 
• Credit risk rating reports, including a list of watch credits. 
• Problem loan reports for adversely rated Ag loans. 
• Customers with carryover debt for the most recent year as well as previous years, 
including the dollar amount of carryover and loans that contain carryover. 
• Concentration of Ag credit reports and board-approved concentration limits. 
• Loan policy exception report. 
• Financial statement and collateral exception reports. 
• Financial statement tracking reports. 
• Board and loan committee reports and minutes related to Ag lending activities. 
• Loans with terms modified by a reduction of the interest rate or principal payment, by 
a deferral of interest or principal, or by other restructuring of payment terms. 
• Loans with interest capitalized subsequent to initial underwriting. 
• Over-disbursed loans. 
• Loan participations purchased and sold since the previous examination. 
• Shared National Credits, if applicable. 
• Organizational chart of the Ag lending department or Ag lending specialist reporting 
lines, if applicable. 
• Résumés of the Ag lending department management and internal loan review staff, 
including any staff added since the last examination. 
• Loans to insiders of the bank or any affiliate of the bank. 
 
4. In discussions with bank management, determine whether there have been any significant 
changes since the prior examination of Ag lending. Discussions should address 
 
• management’s strategy for the Ag lending function, including 
− growth goals. 
− existing and potential sources of loan demand. 
− new loan types, property types, or geographic regions. 
− new marketing strategies and initiatives. 
• staff’s experience and ability to implement strategic initiatives and achieve goals. 
• current and projected concentrations of credit, as well as management’s plans to 
manage concentrations. 
• significant changes in policies, procedures, underwriting, personnel, or control 
systems. 
• internal or external factors that can affect the portfolio. 
• stress-testing practices. 
• observations from examiner review of internal bank reports, as well as OCC and other 
third-party-generated reports.

• extent of syndicated distribution and participation activities as a buyer and a seller, if 
applicable. 
 
5. Based on an analysis of information obtained in the previous steps, as well as input from 
the EIC, determine the scope and objectives of the Ag lending examination. Consider 
 
• growth and acquisitions. 
• board or management changes. 
• changes in third-party relationships.

Quantity of Risk 
 
Conclusion: The quantity of credit and other associated risks is 
(low, moderate, or high). 
 
The quantity of risk considers the inherent level or volume of risk. Consider the “Quantity of 
Credit Risk Indicators” in appendix A of this booklet, as appropriate. 
 
Credit Risk 
 
Objective: To determine the quantity of credit risk associated with Ag lending by assessing the 
product mix, markets, geographies, technologies, volumes, size of the exposures, quality 
metrics, and concentrations. 
 
1. Analyze the composition of and changes to the Ag portfolio, including off-balance-sheet 
exposure, since the previous examination. Determine the implications for the quantity of 
risk from the following: 
 
• Any significant growth. 
• Material changes in the portfolio, including 
− changes and trends in problem, classified, past-due, nonaccrual, and 
nonperforming assets; charge-off volumes; and risk-rating distribution. 
− any significant concentrations. 
− Ag portfolios acquired from other institutions. 
 
2. Assess the effect of external factors, including economic, industry, competitive, and 
market conditions. 
 
3. Assess the effect of potential legislative, regulatory, accounting, and technological 
changes. 
 
4. Select a sample of loans to be reviewed. Selection of the sample should be consistent 
with the examination objectives, supervisory strategy, and the OCC’s annual bank 
supervision operation plan.13 Refer to the “Sampling Methodologies” booklet of the 
Comptroller’s Handbook for guidance on sampling techniques. Consider 
 
• new large loans. 
• new loan types. 
• loans originated in new geographic regions. 
• loans at or above the legal lending limit. 
• loans to insiders of the bank or any affiliates. 
• over-disbursed loans. 
                                                 
13 The OCC’s Committee on Bank Supervision issues an annual bank supervision operating plan that sets forth 
supervisory priorities and objectives for each line of business. (Footnote added in version 1.3)

• loans with multiple extensions. 
• special mention or classified loans. 
• loans identified as having carryover that are not adversely risk rated by the bank. 
• loans with significant policy or underwriting exceptions. 
• loans with modified repayment terms. 
• concentration reports. 
• portfolio stress-testing reports. 
 
5. Obtain and review credit files for all borrowers in the sample and prepare line sheets for 
the sampled credits. Line sheets should contain sufficient analysis to determine the credit 
rating; support any criticisms of underwriting, servicing, or credit administration 
practices; and document any violations of law. In particular, file readers should 
 
• evaluate the quality of underwriting if the loan was originated, renewed, or 
restructured in the last 12 months. Consider whether the approval document is 
consistent with the bank’s underwriting policy. As appropriate, examiners generally 
must use the National Credit Tool to perform the Credit Underwriting Assessment for 
each transaction in the sample. (Updated in version 1.1) 
• determine the primary source of repayment of each loan and evaluate the primary 
source’s adequacy. 
• assess the adequacy of cash flow to meet debt service requirements. 
• comment as necessary regarding historical trends in production levels and income to 
cover operating expenses. 
• evaluate budgeted expenses, including the level and trend of capital expenditures, 
anticipated working capital needs, and significant costs for any necessary capital

ability to repay on reasonable terms. 
• assign risk ratings to the sampled credits. Refer to risk-rating guidance in this booklet 
and supervisory guidance regarding risk ratings. 
 
6. Review the completed line sheets and summarize the loan sample results. The examiner 
responsible for the Ag lending review should 
• if applicable, identify recommended loan risk rating downgrades and assess if 
decisions are appropriately documented in the line sheet. (Updated in version 1.3) 
• maintain a list of structurally weak loans reviewed. 
• complete the Credit Underwriting Assessment to evaluate underwriting practices 
since the previous supervisory activity, and determine the appropriate assessment

exceptions were appropriately identified and approved. 
 
7. Analyze the level, composition, and trend of policy and underwriting exceptions and 
determine the effect on the quantity of risk. Consider the frequency of reporting, total 
dollar volume, percentage of the portfolio, and percentage of total capital that exceptions 
represent in comparison with the bank’s established limits. If the bank does not have an 
internal tracking system, examiners should test the bank’s adherence to its policies.

12. Review “Quantity of Credit Risk Indicators” (appendix A) in this booklet, as appropriate. 
 
13. Discuss the results of the loan sample with the EIC or examiner responsible for the asset 
quality and management component ratings, as appropriate. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Other Associated Risks 
 
In addition to credit risk, Ag lending can generate interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational 
risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputation risk. These risks and the ways Ag lending 
can expose the bank to these risks are discussed in the “Introduction” section of this booklet. 
 
Objective: To determine the quantity of other risks associated with Ag lending activities. 
 
1. Assess the quantity of interest rate risk associated with Ag lending. Consider 
 
• effect of interest rate changes on both the borrowers and the bank. 
• underwriting terms such as tenor and management’s pricing structure, e.g., fixed vs. 
variable interest rates and the potential exposure to different pricing indices. 
• off-balance-sheet exposures. 
• quality and results of sensitivity analysis and portfolio stress testing. 
 
2. Assess the quantity of liquidity risk associated with Ag lending. Consider 
 
• Ag portfolio growth rates and the corresponding funding strategies. 
• composition and trends of the Ag portfolio and the ability to convert the loans to cash. 
Consider correlated concentrations of Ag-related assets and liabilities that may be 
subject to similar supply and demand volatility. 
• current market conditions, including 
− longer-term liquidity pressure due to population migration, depressed commodity 
prices, weather-related disasters, or crop or livestock epidemics. 
− deposit trends in regions dependent on the Ag economy.

Agricultural Lending 
3. Assess the quantity of operational risk associated with Ag lending. Consider 
 
• any operational losses resulting from the Ag lending function. 
• control weaknesses identified by audit, loan review, or any other control group. 
• quality of board oversight. 
• quality of the loan approval and underwriting process. 
• quality of credit administration, e.g., segregation of duties, financial analysis, 
monitoring, and documentation standards. 
• quality and independence of the appraisal and collateral valuation functions. 
• quality and independence of the audit and loan review functions. 
• staffing turnover affecting the Ag lending function. 
• responses to the internal control questionnaire (ICQ). 
 
4. Assess the quantity of compliance risk associated with Ag lending. Consider 
 
• the bank’s history of compliance with lending related laws and regulations, 
particularly those regarding appraisals, insider-lending activities, legal lending limits, 
and affiliates, as well as safe and sound banking practices. 
• for federal savings associations, whether Ag loans are approaching the limits 
described in 12 USC 1464(c)(2)(A) and 12 CFR 160.30. Ag loans typically are 
classified as commercial loans, which, under 12 USC 1464(c)(2)(A), cannot exceed 
20 percent of total assets. Within that limit, amounts in excess of 10 percent of assets 
are used only for small business loans. Small business loans include any loan to a 
small business (defined in 12 CFR 160.3 and 13 CFR 121) and any loan that does not 
exceed $2 million and is for commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural 
purposes. A federal savings association, however, may make Ag loans under other 
authority, depending on the circumstances. For example, to the extent nonresidential 
real property secures an Ag loan, a federal savings association may make the loan 
under its nonresidential loan authority. Under this authority, a federal savings 
association generally may make loans secured by nonresidential real property up to 
400 percent of capital. 
• the quality of the bank’s environmental risk management program and losses 
attributed to liabilities resulting from environmental risk. 
• adherence to internal bank policies and procedures. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
5. Assess the level of strategic risk associated with Ag lending. Consider 
 
• management’s strategy regarding Ag lending and the potential effect on risks 
including concentrations of credit. 
• board oversight of strategic initiatives and stated risk appetite and risk limits as a 
percentage of total capital. 
• the adequacy of the bank’s program for monitoring economic and market conditions. 
Consider management’s assessment of Ag commodity supply and demand, 
government policies, and socioeconomic and demographic trends.

Agricultural Lending 
• ability of the staff to effectively implement Ag lending strategies without exposing 
the bank to unwarranted risk. 
 
6. Assess the level of reputation risk associated with Ag lending. Consider 
 
• the bank’s effectiveness in meeting Ag lending needs of the communities it serves, 
including credit needs of small businesses that depend on the Ag industry. 
• management’s oversight of environmental compliance and social responsibility 
efforts to limit negative public perception and lender liability as they pertain to Ag 
lending. 
• the bank’s effectiveness in working with stressed borrowers and the Ag community 
during periods of economic or financial stress. 
• management’s oversight of large or complex Ag lending relationships that affect the 
local economy.

Quality of Risk Management 
 
Conclusion: The quality of risk management is 
(strong, satisfactory, insufficient, or weak). (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
The conclusion on risk management considers all risks associated with Ag lending. Consider 
the “Quality of Credit Risk Management Indicators” in appendix B of this booklet, as 
appropriate. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Policies 
 
Policies are statements of actions adopted by a bank to pursue certain objectives. Policies 
guide decisions, often set standards (on risk limits, for example), and should be consistent 
with the bank’s underlying mission, risk appetite, and core values. Policies should be 
reviewed periodically for effectiveness and approved by the board of directors or designated 
board committee. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Objective: To determine the adequacy of Ag loan policies. Consider whether the policies address 
the following: 
 
1. Loan structures permitted and how maximum loan amounts are determined. 
 
2. Maximum advance rates or minimum collateral margins for machinery and equipment. 
 
3. Maximum advance rates or minimum collateral margins for all categories of crops and 
livestock in production. 
 
4. Frequency of inspections and collateral revaluations. 
 
5. Frequency and timing of budget or cash flow projection variance analysis. 
 
6. How credit enhancements are used to support credit underwriting, including 
 
• FSA programs. 
• insurance policies. 
• U.S. Small Business Administration programs. 
• state-level programs. 
• personal guarantees. 
 
7. Maximum loan term and whether the term reflects the purpose of the loan and source of 
repayment. 
 
8. Whether the policy establishes guidance for monitoring hedging strategies, forward 
contracting, third-party contracts, and timing of cash market sales.

9. Required documentation and filings. 
 
10. Environmental risk. 
 
11. How Ag loan policy exceptions are defined, identified, monitored, and controlled, 
including expectations for the frequency of exception report updates. Has the board 
established a limit for the percentage of the portfolio with exceptions and does the board 
monitor the bank’s performance against this limit? (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
12. Annual board review and approval of the Ag lending policy. Does management prepare 
and the board (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• evaluate existing policies to determine whether they are compatible with market 
conditions? 
• update stress-testing requirements for borrowers, including the minimum loan size 
that will require management to perform stress tests on an individual borrower? 
• review the bank’s stress-testing policy on the entire Ag loan portfolio and on 
individual segments of the Ag portfolio? 
• confirm that policies are consistent with the board’s strategic direction and risk 
appetite? 
 
13. Reach and document conclusions and findings from the review of the bank’s commercial 
lending policies. Examiner conclusions and findings of the bank’s commercial lending 
policies can also support the “Commercial Credit––Underwriting Assessment” module 
and the “Overall Credit—Underwriting Assessment” module in Examiner View. 
Examiners may add both these modules to the examination activity, if applicable. 
(Updated April 29, 2016) 
 
Processes 
 
Processes are the procedures, programs, and practices that impose order on a bank’s pursuit 
of its objectives. Processes define how activities are carried out and help manage risk. 
Effective processes are consistent with the underlying policies and are governed by 
appropriate checks and balances (such as internal controls). (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Objective: To assess the adequacy of the bank’s lending practices, procedures, and internal controls 
regarding Ag loans. 
 
1. Evaluate how policies, procedures, and plans affecting the Ag portfolio are 
communicated. Consider whether 
 
• management has clearly communicated objectives and risk limits as a percentage of 
total capital for the Ag portfolio to the board of directors and whether the board has 
approved these goals. 
• communication to key personnel in the Ag department is clear and timely.

2. Determine whether MIS, including exception reports, inspection reports, and commodity 
pricing reports, provide timely, useful information to evaluate risk levels and trends in the 
Ag portfolio. 
 
3. Assess the process management uses to determine the accuracy and integrity of Ag loan 
data. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• Is there a process to compare production and expenses from previous budget or cash 
flow projections to actual production and expenses for the same period? 
 
4. Determine the effectiveness of processes to monitor adherence to the bank’s Ag policy. 
Consider (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• approval and monitoring of policy limit exceptions. 
• volume and type of exceptions, including any identified in the loan sample. 
• internal loan review, audit, and compliance review findings. 
 
5. Assess and reach a conclusion on underwriting practices for Ag lending, and complete 
the appropriate sections of the Credit Underwriting Assessment. Consider (Updated April 
29, 2016) 
 
• appropriateness of the approval process, including officers’ approval limits. 
• quality of the loan approval documents. Do they contain the following? 
− Industry analysis. 
− Adequate description of the nature, size, and complexity of the farmer’s or 
rancher’s operations, including management depth and experience. 
− Comprehensive financial analysis of the borrower and any guarantors, including 
repayment capacity and financial projections. 
− Support for the loan structure, including loan term, amortization schedule, pricing, 
loan amount, advance rates, and, if applicable, loan covenants. 
− Identification of loan policy exceptions and any mitigating factors. 
− Identification of key risks and any mitigating factors. 
− Purpose of loan. 
− Primary and secondary sources of repayment. 
− Description of collateral and lien status. 
− Environmental risk factors. 
− Budget or cash flow projection summary, including support for significant budget 
exceptions.

6. Evaluate the accuracy and integrity of the internal risk-rating processes. Consider 
 
• findings from the loan sample. 
• role of internal loan review. 
 
7. Determine whether there are processes to monitor strategic and business plans for the Ag 
portfolio. Consider 
 
• effect on earnings and capital if the Ag portfolio business plans and strategies are 
executed. 
 
8. Assess the processes used to comply with applicable laws, rulings, regulations, and 
environmental guidelines. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• Consider special environmental guidelines pertaining to certain types of Ag 
production (such as hog farms, dairy farms, or aquaculture), if applicable. 
 
9. Evaluate the effectiveness of processes used to monitor Ag collateral. Consider the 
following questions: 
 
• For equipment loans, are values updated periodically? 
• Does the bank have adequate processes to monitor Ag prices? 
• Evaluate the effectiveness of collateral monitoring. Consider the quality, timing, and 
independence of the appraisal and appraisal review functions and inspections, and 
management’s criteria for updating or obtaining new valuations and inspections 
throughout the life of the loan. 
− For livestock loans, 
 are inspections performed at least annually? (Updated in version 1.3) 
 is there a breakdown by sex, breed, and number in each category? 
 is the condition of each animal noted? 
 are published livestock prices used to prepare cash flow projections? 
− For crop loans, 
 are inspections of growing crops performed as the loans are advanced? 
 does the bank monitor local and regional crop yields? 
 are published commodity prices used for cash flow projections? 
 if published commodity prices are not used, does the bank document the 
support for its prices? 
• Does the bank have processes to verify that liens on Ag properties are properly filed 
and perfected? (Updated in version 1.3) 
• Does the bank have processes to monitor the adequacy of insurance coverage?

10. The examiner reviewing the Ag lending portfolio should review the LPM examiner’s 
findings to determine whether additional analysis should be performed for issues related 
to Ag lending pertaining to (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• problem credit administration. 
• collections. 
• charge-offs. 
 
11. Review the methodology for evaluating and maintaining the ALLL. 
 
• Consider whether the portfolio is analyzed as a separate pool or further segmented by 
loan type (for example, crops, livestock, irrigated land, dryland, or equipment) or by 
geographic area. 
• Is the methodology reasonable based on historical experience and current trends? 
 
12. Verify that the bank has an effective process in place to periodically evaluate internal 
controls. (Examiners may need to conduct additional testing such as completing the 
Internal Control Questionnaire, if the bank does not have an effective process.) (Updated 
in version 1.3) 
 
Personnel 
 
Personnel are the bank staff and managers who execute or oversee processes. Personnel 
should be qualified and competent, have clearly defined responsibilities, and be held 
accountable for their actions. They should understand the bank’s mission, risk appetite, core 
values, policies, and processes. Banks should design compensation programs to attract and 
retain personnel, align with strategy, and appropriately balance risk-taking and reward. 
 
Objective: To determine whether management and Ag lending and administrative personnel 
possess and display acceptable knowledge and technical skills to manage and perform their 
duties, given the size and complexity of the bank. 
 
1. Evaluate the adequacy of the Ag lending staff in terms of the level of expertise and 
number of assigned personnel. Consider (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
• whether staffing levels support current operations or any planned growth. 
• staff turnover. 
• staff’s previous Ag lending and workout experience. 
• specialized training provided. 
• average account load per lending officer and whether loads are reasonable in light of 
the complexity and condition of each officer’s portfolio. 
• how senior management and the board of directors periodically evaluate Ag lenders’ 
understanding of and conformance with the board’s stated credit culture and loan 
policy. If there is no process, determine the effect on the management of credit risk.  
• adequacy of training, development, and succession planning.

Agricultural Lending 
2. Assess the performance management and compensation programs for Ag lending 
personnel. Consider whether these programs measure and reward behaviors that support 
strategic and risk objectives for the portfolio. 
 
If the bank offers incentive compensation programs, determine whether they (1) provide 
employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (2) are compatible 
with effective controls and risk management; and (3) are supported by strong corporate 
governance, including active and effective oversight by the board. Refer to OCC Bulletin 
2010-24, “Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies” for more 
information. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
3. If the bank has third-party relationships that involve critical activities related to Ag 
lending, determine whether the bank engages in appropriate third-party risk management 
for such relationships. Refer to OCC Bulletin 2013-29, “Third-Party Relationships: Risk 
Management Guidance,” OCC Bulletin 2017-21, “Third-Party Relationships: Frequently 
Asked Questions to Supplement OCC Bulletin 2013-29,” and OCC Bulletin 2017-7, 
“Third-Party Relationships: Supplemental Examination Procedures.” (Updated in version 
1.3) 
 
Control Systems 
 
Control systems are the functions (such as internal and external audits, and quality assurance) 
and information systems that bank managers use to measure performance, make decisions 
about risk, and assess the effectiveness of processes and personnel. Control functions should 
have clear reporting lines, sufficient resources, and appropriate access and authority. 
Management information systems should provide timely, accurate, and relevant feedback. 
(Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Objective: To determine whether the bank has systems in place to provide accurate and timely 
assessments of the risks associated with its Ag lending activities. 
 
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of monitoring systems to identify, measure, and track Ag 
concentrations and exceptions to policies and established limits. 
 
2. Determine whether MIS provides timely, accurate, and useful information to evaluate 
risk levels and trends in the bank’s Ag lending activities. 
 
3. Assess the scope, frequency, effectiveness, and independence of the internal and external 
audits of the Ag lending function. Consider the qualifications of audit personnel and 
evaluate accessibility to necessary information and board responses to audit findings. 
 
4. Assess the effectiveness of loan review. Evaluate the scope, frequency, effectiveness, and 
independence of loan review, as well as loan review’s ability to identify and report 
emerging risks. Determine whether loan review reports address 
 
• quality of the Ag loan portfolio.

Verification Procedures 
 
Verification procedures are used to verify the existence of assets and liabilities, or test the 
reliability of financial records. Examiners generally do not perform verification procedures as 
part of a typical examination. Rather, verification procedures are performed when substantive 
safety and soundness concerns are identified that are not mitigated by the bank’s risk 
management systems and internal controls. 
 
1. Reconcile the trial balance to the general ledger. Include loan commitments, overdrafts, 
and other contingent liabilities in the testing. 
 
2. Using an appropriate sampling technique, select loans from the trial balance and do the 
following: 
 
• Prepare and mail confirmation forms to borrowers. Loans serviced by other 
institutions, either whole loans or participations, should be confirmed only with the 
servicing institution. Loans serviced for other institutions, either whole loans or 
participations, should be confirmed with the other institution and the borrower. 
Confirmation forms should include the borrower’s name, loan number, original 
amount, interest rate, current loan balance, contingency or escrow account balance 
and a brief description of the collateral. 
− After a reasonable time period, mail second requests. 
− Follow up on any no-replies or exceptions and resolve differences. 
• Examine notes for completeness and reconcile date, amount, and terms to trial 
balance. 
− If any notes are not held at the bank, request confirmation with the holder. 
− See that required initials of approving officer are on the note. 
− See that the note is signed, appears to be genuine, and is negotiable. 
• Compare collateral held in files with the description on the collateral register. List and 
investigate all collateral discrepancies. 
• Determine whether any collateral is held by an outside custodian or has been 
temporarily removed for any reason. Request confirmation for any collateral held. 
• Determine whether each file contains documentation supporting guarantees and 
subordination agreements, where appropriate. 
• Determine whether any required insurance coverage is adequate and that the bank is 
named as loss payee. 
• Review participation agreements, making excerpts, when deemed necessary, for such 
items as rate of service fee, interest rate, retention of late charges, and remittance 
requirements, and determine whether the customer has complied. 
• Review loan agreement provisions for holdback or retention, and determine whether 
undisbursed loan funds or contingency or escrow accounts are equal to retention or 
holdback requirements. 
− If separate reserves are maintained, determine whether debit entries to those 
accounts are authorized in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and

whether they are supported by inspection reports, individual bills, or other 
evidence. 
• Review disbursement ledgers and authorizations and determine whether 
authorizations are signed in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. 
• Reconcile debits in the undisbursed loan proceeds accounts to inspection reports, 
individual bills, or other evidence supporting disbursements. 
 
3. Review the accrued-interest accounts and 
 
• review procedures for accounting for accrued interest and handling of adjustments. 
• scan accrued-interest and income accounts for any unusual entries and follow up on 
any unusual items by tracing to initial and supporting records. 
 
4. Obtain or prepare a schedule showing the amount of monthly interest income and the real 
estate loan balances at the end of each month since the last examination and 
 
• calculate or check yield. 
• investigate significant fluctuations or trends. 
 
5. Using a list of nonaccruing loans, check loan accrual records to determine whether 
interest income is being accrued.

Appendix A: Quantity of Credit Risk Indicators 
 
Examiners should consider the following indicators when assessing the quantity of credit risk 
in Ag lending activities. 
 
Low 
Moderate 
High 
The level of Ag loans outstanding 
is low relative to capital.  
The level of Ag loans outstanding 
is moderate relative to capital. 
The level of Ag loans outstanding 
is high relative to capital. 
Ag growth rates are supported by 
local, regional, or national 
economic trends. Growth, 
including off-balance-sheet 
activities, has been planned for 
and is commensurate with 
management and staff expertise, 
as well as operational capabilities. 
Ag growth rates exceed local, 
regional, or national economic 
trends. Growth, including off-
balance-sheet activities, has not 
been planned for or exceeds 
planned levels and may test the 
capabilities of management, 
credit staff, and MIS. 
Ag growth rates significantly 
exceed local, regional, or national 
economic trends. Growth, 
including off-balance-sheet 
activities, has not been planned 
for or exceeds planned levels and 
stretches the experience and 
capability of management, credit 
staff, and MIS. Growth may also 
be in new products or outside the 
bank’s traditional lending area. 
Interest and fee income from Ag 
lending activities is not a 
significant portion of loan income. 
Interest and fee income from Ag 
lending activities is an important 
component of loan income; 
however, the bank’s lending 
activities remain diversified. 
The bank is highly dependent on 
interest and fees from Ag lending 
activities. Management may seek 
higher returns through higher-risk 
product or customer types. Loan 
yields may be disproportionate 
relative to risk. 
The bank’s Ag portfolio is well 
diversified, with no single large 
concentrations or a few moderate 
concentrations. Concentrations 
are well within reasonable internal 
limits. The Ag portfolio mix does 
not materially affect the risk 
profile. 
The bank has a few material Ag 
concentrations that may be 
approaching internal limits. The 
Ag portfolio mix may increase the 
bank’s credit risk profile. 
The bank has large Ag 
concentrations that may exceed 
internal limits. The Ag portfolio 
mix increases the bank’s credit 
risk profile. 
Ag underwriting is conservative. 
Policies and procedures are 
reasonable. Ag loans with 
structural weaknesses or 
underwriting exceptions are 
occasionally originated; however, 
the weaknesses are effectively 
mitigated. 
Ag underwriting is satisfactory. 
The bank has an average level of 
Ag loans with structural 
weaknesses. Exceptions are 
reasonably mitigated and 
consistent with competitive 
pressures and reasonable growth 
objectives. 
Ag underwriting is liberal and 
policies are inadequate. The bank 
has a high level of Ag loans with 
structural weaknesses or 
underwriting exceptions, the 
volume of which exposes the 
bank to loss in the event of 
default. 
Collateral requirements for Ag 
loans are conservative. Collateral 
valuations are reasonable, timely, 
and well supported.  
Collateral requirements for Ag 
loans are acceptable. Some 
collateral exceptions exist, but are 
reasonably mitigated and 
monitored. A moderate volume of 
collateral valuations are not well 
supported. Updated collateral 
valuations are not always 
obtained in a timely manner. 
Collateral requirements for Ag 
loans are liberal, or if policies are 
conservative, substantial 
deviations exist. Collateral 
valuations are not always 
obtained, frequently unsupported, 
or reflect inadequate protection. 
Updated collateral values are not 
obtained in a timely manner.

Agricultural Lending 
Low 
Moderate 
High 
Ag loan documentation or 
collateral exceptions are low and 
have minimal effect on the bank’s 
risk profile. 
The level of Ag loan 
documentation or collateral 
exceptions is moderate; however, 
exceptions are reasonably 
mitigated and corrected in a 
timely manner, if applicable. The 
risk of loss from these exceptions 
is not material. 
The level of Ag loan 
documentation or collateral 
exceptions is high. Exceptions are 
not mitigated and not corrected in 
a timely manner. The risk of loss 
from the exceptions is 
heightened. 
Ag loan distribution across pass 
category is consistent with a 
conservative risk appetite. 
Migration trends within the pass 
category favor the less risky 
ratings. Lagging indicators, 
including past dues and 
nonaccruals, are low and stable. 
Ag distribution across pass 
category is consistent with a 
moderate risk appetite. Migration 
trends within the pass category 
may favor riskier ratings. Lagging 
indicators, including past dues 
and nonaccruals, are moderate 
and may be slightly increasing. 
Ag distribution across the pass 
category is heavily skewed 
toward riskier pass ratings. 
Lagging indicators, including past 
dues and nonaccruals, are 
moderate or high and the trend is 
increasing. 
The volume of classified and 
special mention Ag loans is low 
and is not skewed toward more 
severe risk ratings. 
The volume of classified and 
special mention Ag loans is 
moderate but is not skewed 
toward more severe ratings. 
The volume of classified and 
special mention Ag loans is 
moderate or high, skewed to the 
more severe ratings, and 
increasing. 
Ag refinancing and renewal 
practices raise little or no concern 
regarding the quality of Ag loans 
and the accuracy of reported 
problem loan data. 
Ag refinancing and renewal 
practices pose some concerns 
regarding the quality of Ag loans 
and the accuracy of reported 
problem loan data. 
Ag refinancing and renewal 
practices raise substantial 
concerns regarding the quality of 
Ag loans and the accuracy of 
reported problem loan data. 
The volume of loans secured by 
Ag with environmental issues is 
not significant. Environmental 
analyses are timely, appropriate, 
and well supported. 
A moderate volume of Ag loans 
with environmental concerns 
exists; however, the risks are 
identified and reasonably 
mitigated. Environmental 
evaluations are not always 
performed in a timely manner.  
The volume of Ag loans with 
environmental concerns is 
material if left uncorrected. 
Environmental evaluations are not 
performed in a timely manner or 
management’s response to 
identified environmental issues is 
not appropriate.

Appendix B: Quality of Credit Risk Management Indicators 
 
Examiners should consider the following indicators when assessing the quality of credit risk 
management in Ag lending activities. 
 
Strong 
Satisfactory 
Weak 
There is a clear, sound Ag credit 
culture. Board and management 
appetite for risk is well 
communicated and fully 
understood. 
The intent of Ag lending activities 
is generally understood, but the 
culture and risk appetite may not 
be clearly communicated or 
uniformly implemented throughout 
the bank. 
The Ag credit culture is absent or 
materially flawed. Risk appetite 
may not be well understood. 
Ag initiatives are consistent with a 
conservative risk appetite and 
promote an appropriate balance 
between risk taking and strategic 
objectives. New Ag loan products 
are well researched, tested, and 
approved before implementation. 
Ag initiatives are consistent with a 
moderate risk appetite. Generally, 
there is an appropriate balance 
between risk taking and strategic 
objectives; however, anxiety for 
income may lead to higher-risk 
transactions. New Ag products 
may be launched without 
sufficient testing, but risks are 
generally understood. 
Ag initiatives are liberal and 
encourage risk taking. Anxiety for 
income dominates planning 
activities. The bank introduces 
new Ag products without 
conducting sufficient due 
diligence. 
Management is effective. The Ag 
lending staff possesses sufficient 
expertise to effectively administer 
the risk assumed. Responsibilities 
and accountability are clear, and 
appropriate remedial or corrective 
action is taken when they are 
breached. 
Ag risk management is 
satisfactory, but improvement 
may be needed in one or more 
areas. Ag lending staff generally 
possesses the expertise to 
administer assumed risks; 
however, additional expertise may 
be required. Responsibilities and 
accountability may require some 
clarification. In general, 
appropriate remedial or corrective 
action is taken when they are 
breached. 
Ag risk management is deficient. 
Ag lending staff may not possess 
sufficient expertise or may 
demonstrate an unwillingness to 
effectively administer the risk 
assumed. Responsibilities and 
accountability may not be clear. 
Corrective actions are insufficient 
to address root causes of 
problems. 
Diversification management is 
effective. Ag concentration limits 
are set at reasonable levels. Ag 
concentration risk management 
practices are sound, including 
management’s efforts to reduce 
or mitigate exposures. 
Management effectively identifies 
and understands correlated risk 
exposures and their potential 
effects. 
Diversification management is 
adequate, but certain aspects 
may need improvement. Ag 
concentrations are identified and 
reported, but limits and other 
action triggers may be absent or 
moderately high. Concentration 
management efforts may be 
focused at the individual loan 
level, while portfolio-level efforts 
may be inadequate. Correlated 
exposures may not be identified 
and their risks not fully 
understood. 
Diversification management is 
passive or deficient. Management 
may not identify concentrations, 
or take little or no action to 
reduce, limit, or mitigate the 
associated risk. Limits may be 
present but represent a significant 
portion of capital. Management 
may not understand exposure 
correlations and their potential 
effects. Concentration limits may 
be exceeded or raised frequently. 
Loan management and personnel 
compensation structures provide 
appropriate balance between 
loan/revenue production, loan 
quality, and portfolio 
administration, including risk 
identification. 
Loan management and personnel 
compensation structures provide 
reasonable balance between 
loan/revenue production, loan 
quality, and portfolio 
administration. 
Loan management and personnel 
compensation structures are 
skewed to loan/revenue 
production. There is little 
evidence of substantive 
incentives or accountability for 
loan quality or portfolio 
administration.

Ag staffing levels and expertise 
are appropriate for the size and 
complexity of Ag activities. Staff 
turnover is low and the transfer of 
responsibilities is orderly. Training 
programs facilitate ongoing staff 
development. 
Ag staffing levels and expertise 
are generally adequate for the 
size and complexity of the Ag 
activities. Staff turnover is 
moderate and may result in some 
temporary gaps in portfolio 
management. Training initiatives 
are adequate. 
Ag staffing levels and expertise 
are deficient. Turnover is high. 
Management does not provide 
sufficient resources for staff 
training. 
Ag lending policies effectively 
establish and communicate 
portfolio objectives, risk limits as a 
percentage of total capital, loan 
underwriting standards, and risk 
selection standards. 
Ag lending policies are 
fundamentally adequate. 
Enhancement, while generally not 
critical, can be achieved in one or 
more areas. Specificity of risk 
limits as a percentage of total 
capital or underwriting standards 
may need improvement to fully 
communicate policy 
requirements. 
Ag lending policies are deficient in 
one or more ways and require 
significant improvements. Policies 
may not be clear or are too 
general to adequately 
communicate portfolio objectives, 
risk limits as a percentage of total 
capital, and underwriting and risk 
selection standards. 
Staff effectively identifies, 
approves, tracks, and reports 
significant policy, underwriting, 
and risk selection exceptions 
individually and in aggregate, 
including risk exposures 
associated with off-balance-sheet 
activities. 
Staff identifies, approves, and 
reports significant policy, 
underwriting, and risk selection 
exceptions on a loan-by-loan 
basis, including risk exposures 
associated with off-balance-sheet 
activities; however, little 
aggregation or trend analysis is 
conducted to determine the effect 
on portfolio quality. 
Staff approves significant policy 
exceptions but does not report 
them individually or in aggregate 
or does not analyze the effect of 
exceptions on portfolio quality. 
Risk exposures associated with 
off-balance-sheet activities may 
not be considered. Policy 
exceptions may not receive 
appropriate approval. 
Credit analysis is thorough and 
timely, both at underwriting and 
periodically thereafter. 
Credit analysis appropriately 
identifies key risks and is 
conducted within reasonable time 
frames. Monitoring may need 
improvement. 
Credit analysis is deficient. 
Analysis is superficial and key 
risks are overlooked. Credit data 
are not reviewed in a timely 
manner. 
Risk rating and problem loan 
review and identification systems 
are accurate and timely. Credit 
risk is effectively stratified for both 
problem and pass-rated credits. 
Systems serve as effective early 
warning tools and support risk-
based pricing, the ALLL, and 
capital allocations. 
Risk rating and problem loan 
review and identification systems 
are adequate. Problem and 
emerging problem credits are 
adequately identified, although 
room for improvement exists. The 
graduation of pass ratings may 
need to be expanded to facilitate 
early warning, risk-based pricing, 
or capital allocations. 
Risk rating and problem loan 
review and identification systems 
are deficient. Problem credits may 
not be identified accurately or in a 
timely manner, resulting in 
misstated levels of portfolio risk. 
The graduation of pass ratings is 
insufficient to stratify risk in pass 
credits for early warning or other 
purposes. 
Special mention ratings do not 
indicate any issues regarding 
administration of the Ag portfolio. 
Special mention ratings generally 
do not indicate administration 
issues within the Ag portfolio. 
Special mention ratings indicate 
management is not properly 
administering the Ag portfolio. 
MIS provides accurate, timely, 
and complete Ag portfolio 
information. Management and the 
board receive appropriate reports 
to analyze and understand the 
effect of Ag activities on the 
bank’s credit risk profile, including 
off-balance-sheet activities. MIS 
facilitates timely exception 
reporting. 
Management and the board 
generally receive appropriate 
reports to analyze and 
understand the effect of Ag 
activities on the bank’s credit risk 
profile; however, modest 
improvement may be needed in 
one or more areas. MIS facilitates 
generally timely exception 
reporting. 
MIS is deficient. The accuracy or 
timeliness of information may be 
affected in a material way. 
Management and the board may 
not be receiving sufficient 
information to analyze and 
understand the effect of Ag 
activities on the credit risk profile 
of the bank. Exception reporting 
requires improvement.

Appendix C: USDA Guarantee Programs 
 
The USDA has a number of loan guarantee programs intended to assist small farmers and 
residents of rural communities. The programs described in this section were originally 
implemented by the FmHA, an agency within the USDA. Although the FmHA was abolished 
in reorganization, its programs remain intact and are administered by other units within the 
USDA, such as the FSA. 
 
Farm Service Agency 
 
Farm lending by the FSA is probably the most familiar of the government loan programs in 
rural areas. FSA guaranteed loans are direct obligations of the U.S. government. The FSA 
operates numerous offices and administers the USDA’s commodity income and price support 
programs, farm credit programs, marketing programs, and federal crop insurance programs. 
FSA loans serve as the federal government’s primary credit safety net for Ag producers. To 
qualify for loans, an applicant must demonstrate sufficient farm training or farm experience 
and be a current or future operator of a family-size (or smaller) farm. 
 
The FSA provides credit assistance to farmers through two mechanisms: loan guarantees and 
direct loans. Direct loans are made and serviced directly by FSA staff, often at subsidized 
interest rates and concessionary terms and collateral requirements. The FSA also guarantees 
certain types of loans made and serviced by qualified commercial or cooperative lenders. 
 
Loan guarantees: Under a guaranteed loan, the FSA guarantees repayment of up to 
90 percent of a loan made by a qualifying lender if the borrower defaults. A 95 percent 
guarantee is available for the refinancing of direct loan program debt or for farmers who 
qualify for a beginning farmer program. 
 
The FSA can guarantee operating loans (OL) or farm ownership loans (FO) up to an amount 
that is adjusted annually based on inflation.14 An FSA guarantee is transferable, and many 
guaranteed loans are sold through formal and informal secondary markets. While the FSA 
makes some guaranteed loans directly, commercial banks are the major source of guaranteed 
loans. Interest rates are negotiated between the lender and the borrower but are not to exceed 
the average rate the lender offers its farm customers. This requirement and the government’s 
assumption of risk provide borrowers with more favorable rates than the borrower may be 
able to obtain without a guarantee. Under the Interest Assistance Program, the FSA can 
provide interest rate subsidies of up to 4 percentage points on guaranteed loans. 
 
Guaranteed loans are the property and responsibility of the lender. The lender makes the loan 
and services it to conclusion. If successful, the borrower is able to repay the loan and no 
taxpayer money is used except for administrative expenses. If a loan fails, and the lender 
suffers a loss, the FSA reimburses the lender with federal funds according to the terms and 
conditions specified in the guarantee. The lender must notify the FSA when a borrower is 
                                                 
14 Annual adjustments for inflation and updated guarantee maximums can be accessed at 
www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA. The limit for fiscal year 2014 was $1,355,000.

Agricultural Lending 
30 days overdue on a payment and unlikely to bring the account current within 60 days, or if 
the loan is otherwise a problem. Lenders are encouraged to work with borrowers to resolve 
problems. 
 
Direct loans: The FSA offers three groups of loan programs: 
 
• Farm ownership: FO direct and guaranteed loans are available for the purchase or 
improvement of farm real estate. Guaranteed loans also are available to help owner-
operators restructure their debts using real estate equities. FO loans cannot exceed 
40 years. For an FO loan, the producer must also own the farm. 
• Operating loans: OLs are available for purposes including the purchase of livestock and 
farm equipment, annual operating expenses, the refinancing of existing indebtedness, and 
essential family living expenses. OLs can also be used to pay for minor improvements to 
buildings or, under certain conditions, for costs associated with land and water 
development. OLs are normally repaid within seven years. For an OL, the producer must 
be the operator of a family farm after the loan is closed. 
• Emergency loans (EM): EMs are made directly by the FSA. EMs are available to 
producers in designated areas where property damage or severe production losses have 
occurred due to a natural disaster, such as a flood or drought. Loans are made for the 
actual losses arising from the natural disaster. EMs may be made to repair, restore, or 
replace damaged farm property and to compensate for loss of income based on reduced 
production of crops or livestock resulting from the disaster. For EM requests over a 
designated amount, the applicant must provide to the FSA written confirmation from two 
commercial lenders that the requested credit could not be obtained. 
 
Credit Program Changes and Restrictions 
 
Changes were made to the EM program to reduce program costs. Stricter eligibility 
requirements are now applied, and asset valuation procedures have been revised. 
Changes to the EM program are common, and accordingly, management should closely 
monitor any legislative changes to evaluate how the bank’s Ag borrowers may be affected by 
such changes. (Updated in version 1.3) 
 
Commodity Credit Corporation 
 
The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a government-owned and –operated 
corporation created in 1933 to help stabilize and support farm prices and income and to help 
maintain balanced supplies and the orderly distribution of Ag commodities. The CCC’s 
operations for the USDA include commodity price support and inventory management 
programs, donations and sales of government-owned stocks for humanitarian or commercial 
uses, and foreign market development and export credit guarantee programs. In addition, the 
CCC provides low-interest loans for grain storage. 
 
Among the many programs administered by the CCC, the export credit guarantee programs 
and the Commodity Price Support Loan and Purchase Program are of particular interest to 
banks and examiners. 
Comptrollers Handbook agricultural lending
Version 1.4 
Appendixes > Appendix C 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
60 
Agricultural Lending 
Export credit guarantee programs: The export guarantee programs are intended to 
encourage U.S. financial institutions to provide financing where they would be unwilling to 
extend credit in the absence of the CCC guarantee. Under the Export Credit Guarantee 
Program (GSM-102), which was instituted in 1980, the CCC guarantees, for a fee, payments 
due to U.S. exporters under deferred payment sales contracts of up to 36 months. The 
guarantee provides protection against defaults resulting from both commercial and 
noncommercial risks. The Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) was 
implemented in 1986. The program is similar to the GSM-102 program, but provides the 
CCC guarantee to exporters for commodities sold on credit terms in excess of three years, 
although not more than 10 years. Documentation requirements for the GSM-102 and GSM-
103 programs are very specific and require strict adherence to perfect the CCC guarantee. 
 
Commodity Price Support Loan and Purchase Program: Price support is achieved 
through FSA loans, target price deficiency payments, and purchases of selected commodities 
at announced levels. Price-supported loans give producers an opportunity to obtain operating 
cash and remove their crops from the market for potential later sale. Producers are 
guaranteed at least the support price for the commodity they have pledged as collateral for 
the loan. 
 
FSA price support loans are nonrecourse loans. If market prices are above support levels, 
producers may market commodities and pay off loans with interest. If market prices fail to 
rise above support levels, the producer can deliver the commodity to the CCC and discharge 
the obligation. When the producer also has operating loans from another lender, the lender is 
required to sign a lien waiver in favor of the CCC. 
 
Most farm program payments to producers may be assigned to a lender, but price support 
loans, purchase agreement proceeds, and payments made in the form of commodity 
certificates are not assignable.

Appendix D: Lending Limits 
 
Generally, national banks and federal savings associations are subject to the same general 
lending limits (see 12 CFR 32 for both national banks and federal savings associations). 
There is one additional provision, however, that is applicable only to federal savings 
associations in the context of Ag lending, as indicated in 12 CFR 32.3(d). This federal 
savings association exception is described in the lending limits discussion under 12 CFR 32.3 
below. 
 
Ag lending is sometimes subject to special lending limits. Summaries of the special lending 
limits are as follows: 
 
12 CFR 32.3, “Lending Limits” 
 
(a) Combined general limit. A bank’s total outstanding loans and extensions of credit to one 
borrower may not exceed 15 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus, plus an additional 
10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus if the amount that exceeds the bank’s 15 percent 
general limit is fully secured by readily marketable collateral, as defined in 12 CFR 32.2(v). 
To qualify for the additional 10 percent limit, the bank must perfect a security interest in the 
collateral under applicable law and the collateral must have a current market value at all 
times of at least 100 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit that exceeds the 
bank’s 15 percent general limit. 
 
(b) Loans subject to special lending limits. The following loans or extensions of credit are 
subject to the lending limits set forth below. When loans and extensions of credit qualify for 
more than one special lending limit, the special limits are cumulative. 
 
(1) Loans secured by bills of lading or warehouse receipts covering readily marketable 
staples. 
 
(i) A bank’s loans or extensions of credit to one borrower secured by bills of lading, 
warehouse receipts, or similar documents transferring or securing title to readily marketable 
staples, as defined in 12 CFR 32.2(w), may not exceed 35 percent of the bank’s capital and 
surplus in addition to the amount allowed under the bank’s combined general limit. The 
market value of the staples securing the loan must at all times equal at least 115 percent of 
the amount of the outstanding loan that exceeds the bank’s combined general limit. 
 
(ii) Staples that qualify for this special limit must be nonperishable, may be refrigerated or 
frozen, and must be fully covered by insurance if such insurance is customary. Whether a 
staple is nonperishable must be determined on a case-by-case basis because of differences in 
handling and storing commodities. 
 
(iii) This special limit applies to a loan or extension of credit arising from a single transaction 
or secured by the same staples, provided that the duration of the loan or extension of credit is: 
 
(A) Not more than 10 months if secured by nonperishable staples; or

Agricultural Lending 
(B) Not more than six months if secured by refrigerated or frozen staples. 
 
(iv) The holder of the warehouse receipts, order bills of lading, documents qualifying as 
documents of title under the UCC, or other similar documents, must have control and be able 
to obtain immediate possession of the staple so that the bank is able to sell the underlying 
staples and promptly transfer title and possession to a purchaser if default should occur on a 
loan secured by such documents. The existence of a brief notice period or similar procedural 
requirements under applicable law, for the disposal of the collateral will not affect the 
eligibility of the instruments for this special limit. 
 
(A) Field warehouse receipts are an acceptable form of collateral when issued by a duly 
bonded and licensed grain elevator or warehouse having exclusive possession and control of 
the staples even though the grain elevator or warehouse is maintained on the premises of the 
owner of the staples. 
 
(B) Warehouse receipts issued by the borrower-owner that is a grain elevator or warehouse 
company, duly-bonded and licensed and regularly inspected by state or federal authorities, 
may be considered eligible collateral under this provision only when the receipts are 
registered with an independent registrar whose consent is required before the staples may be 
withdrawn from the warehouse. 
 
(3) Loans secured by documents covering livestock. 
 
(i) A bank’s loans or extensions of credit to one borrower secured by shipping documents or 
instruments that transfer or secure title to or give a first lien on livestock may not exceed 
10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus in addition to the amount allowed under the 
bank’s combined general limit. The market value of the livestock securing the loan must at 
all times equal at least 115 percent of the amount of the outstanding loan that exceeds the 
bank’s combined general limit. For purposes of this subsection, the term “livestock” includes 
dairy and beef cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, horses, mules, poultry, and fish, whether or not held 
for resale. 
 
(ii) The bank must maintain in its files an inspection and valuation for the livestock pledged 
that is reasonably current, taking into account the nature and frequency of turnover of the 
livestock to which the documents relate, but in any case not more than 12 months old. 
 
(iii) Under the laws of certain states, persons furnishing pasturage under a grazing contract 
may have a lien on the livestock for the amount due for pasturage. If a lien that is based on 
pasturage furnished by the lien or prior to the bank’s loan or extension of credit is assigned to 
the bank by a recordable instrument and protected against being defeated by some other lien 
or claim, by payment to a person other than the bank, or otherwise, it will qualify under this 
exception provided the amount of the perfected lien is at least equal to the amount of the loan 
and the value of the livestock is at no time less than 115 percent of the portion of the loan or 
extension of credit that exceeds the bank’s combined general limit. When the amount due 
under the grazing contract is dependent upon future performance, the resulting lien does not 
meet the requirements of the exception.

Agricultural Lending 
(4) Loans secured by dairy cattle. A bank’s loans and extensions of credit to one borrower 
that arise from the discount by dealers in dairy cattle of paper given in payment for the cattle 
may not exceed 10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus in addition to the amount 
allowed under the bank’s combined general limit. To qualify, the paper: 
 
(i) Must carry the full recourse endorsement or unconditional guarantee of the seller; and 
 
(ii) Must be secured by the cattle being sold, pursuant to liens that allow the bank to maintain 
a perfected security interest in the cattle under applicable law. 
 
(5) (Not related to agriculture) 
 
(c) Loans not subject to the lending limits. 
 
(d) Special lending limits for savings associations. 
 
(1) $500,000 exception. If a savings association’s aggregate lending limitation is less than 
$500,000, such savings association may have total loans and extension of credit, for any 
purpose, to one borrower outstanding at one time not to exceed $500,000.
