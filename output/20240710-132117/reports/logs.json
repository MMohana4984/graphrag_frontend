This practice is a critical business line for many banks, particularly in rural areas, and involves supporting agricultural enterprises through credit and financial products. AG Lending encompasses a wide range of activities, including the planting and harvesting of crops, raising livestock, and marketing harvested commodities.\n\nBanks engaged in AG Lending must navigate various operational, compliance, and credit risks. These risks necessitate detailed underwriting practices, risk management policies, and specialized examination procedures to ensure compliance and performance. The process also involves assessing strategic, reputation, and environmental risks, as well as implementing specific administrative functions and controls to mitigate these risks.\n\nOverall, AG Lending is subject to examination and supervision to ensure that banks adhere to regulatory requirements and maintain strong internal controls. This sector is vital for the agricultural industry, providing essential financial support for both commercial and personal agricultural operations.\",35\r\n31,\"\"\"BANKS\"\"\",\"Banks are financial institutions that provide a wide range of financial services, including managing deposits, offering investment products, and providing various types of loans such as short-term, variable rate, and fixed-rate financing. They engage in lending activities to agricultural enterprises, individual farm operators, and grain elevators, offering essential financing for agricultural operations, capital investments, and the development of new agricultural technologies and techniques.\n\nTo manage the risks associated with agricultural lending, banks are encouraged to stratify their agricultural portfolios into segments, develop policies and procedures for monitoring, verifying, and controlling inventory based on the borrower's risk profile, and ensure effective collateral valuation programs to monitor and verify crop or livestock collateral coverage. They must also quantify the use of derivatives by grain elevators and assess the resulting financial risks.\n\nBanks face reputation risk from negative public opinion and potential litigation related to environmental contamination and lending decisions. They must adhere to prudent lending standards, ensure collateral lien perfection, and comply with regulations to mitigate these risks. Additionally, banks are exposed to interest rate risk due to the various types of loans they provide.\n\nOverall, banks play a crucial role in supporting the agricultural sector by underwriting, administering, and managing agricultural credits, and providing financing for a broad spectrum of agricultural products while assuming the risks associated with borrowers' agricultural activities.\",34\r\n99,\"\"\"AG BORROWERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Ag Borrowers\"\" are individuals or entities engaged in agricultural activities who seek loans and financial support from banks to finance their operations.
