For Ag loans secured by real estate, price risk can occur upon a \nbank\u2019s foreclosure or physical possession of a property, whereby the loan is transferred into \nother real estate owned (OREO). During the holding period, OREO must be carried at the \nlower of cost or fair value (less estimated costs to sell).
