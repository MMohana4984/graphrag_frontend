Ag loans typically are \nclassified as commercial loans, which, under 12 USC 1464(c)(2)(A), cannot exceed \n20 percent of total assets. Within that limit, amounts in excess of 10 percent of assets \nare used only for small business loans. Small business loans include any loan to a \nsmall business (defined in 12 CFR 160.3 and 13 CFR 121) and any loan that does not \nexceed $2 million and is for commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural \npurposes. A federal savings association, however, may make Ag loans under other \nauthority, depending on the circumstances. For example, to the extent nonresidential \nreal property secures an Ag loan, a federal savings association may make the loan \nunder its nonresidential loan authority.
