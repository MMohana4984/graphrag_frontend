Market \nprice volatility and production cost volatility can affect both revenues (output) and expenses \n(input). Because many Ag products are globally traded commodities, currency exchange rate \nvolatility may also affect prices. Some Ag products are marketed locally, such as vegetables, \nwhile other products are primarily marketed on a national basis or are simply more \ncompetitive domestically due to tariffs, growing conditions, or other influences. Rapid rises \nin interest rates can cause increased capitalization rates, resulting in reduced farmland values. \nAll of these factors can present risk to an Ag borrower\u2019s repayment capacity. \n \nFarmers and ranchers can mitigate market risk by using a variety of strategies. These include \ndiversifying crop and livestock products, hedging commodities under production, contracting \n(pre-selling) production, and hedging or contracting input commodities. Accurate budgeting \nand financial management play crucial roles in whether such strategies are successful. \nManagement should have a sound understanding of the financial effect these strategies have \non Ag borrowers.
