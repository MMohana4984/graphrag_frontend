Larger farms, \nhowever, tend to retain more financial leverage and thus more risk. \n \nChanges in consumers\u2019 preferences have increased demand for farm products raised in a \nnoncommercial setting, creating niche markets often filled by smaller, independent operators. \nExamples of growth in niche markets include demand for organic foods, specialty crops, \nfree-range livestock and poultry, and gluten-free products. Also, demand for certain food \ntypes can vary because of demographic changes and general public perception. Prices may \nrise or fall based on these changes.
