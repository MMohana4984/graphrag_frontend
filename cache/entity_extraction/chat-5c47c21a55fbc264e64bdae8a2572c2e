Farmers can select the \npercentage of yield differential they will receive. Unit prices are based on the pre-planting \nprice per unit set in futures contracts. \n \nCrop hail insurance is another form of yield insurance available to provide coverage against \nloss to growing crops caused by hail. Depending on the crop insured, a crop hail policy may \nalso provide coverage for loss caused by fire, lightning, wind (when accompanied by hail), \nvandalism, or malicious mischief. The crop may also be insured while in transportation sand \nduring storage. \n \nBanks should be able to obtain information from borrowers regarding the type of insurance \nselected (i.e., whether yield or revenue), crop pricing options, coverage percentage, and \nwhether the borrower is in compliance with the terms of the contract.
