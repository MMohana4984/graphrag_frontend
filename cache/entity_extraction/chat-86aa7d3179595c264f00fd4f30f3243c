As a result, banks need an \neffective collateral valuation program to monitor and verify crop or livestock collateral \ncoverage. \n \nAn inspection and reevaluation should be performed by a qualified person other than the \nlending officer responsible for the credit decision. When such a separation of duties is \nimpossible or impractical, every effort should be made to periodically reaffirm inspection \nresults by independent means. Methods banks have used to accomplish this include \nperiodically rotating inspection duties among bank personnel other than the primary lending \nofficer, using outside directors as inspectors/reappraisers, and contracting the services of an \nindependent third party. Further, a dual inspection process can provide effective controls, \nwhen feasible. This inspection approach includes a simultaneous inspection by the servicing \nloan officer and another qualified inspector/reappraiser independent of loan production. As \nwith any confirmation process, greater credibility is placed on the results of inspections that \nare conducted unannounced. \n \nShort-term production loans require varying degrees of collateral monitoring, in addition to \nfinancial analysis and initial collateral perfection. This monitoring typically includes periodic \ninspections and reappraisals/evaluations. Depending on the type of collateral and the \noperating cycle, the lender should inspect and reevaluate short-term collateral at least once \nduring the term of the loan. Most Ag lenders are aware of the growing conditions in their \ntrade areas, which gives them a sense of expected borrower crop conditions. \n \nComptrollers Handbook agricultural\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
