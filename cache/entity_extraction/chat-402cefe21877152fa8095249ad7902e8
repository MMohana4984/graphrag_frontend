The programs described in this section were originally \nimplemented by the FmHA, an agency within the USDA. Although the FmHA was abolished \nin reorganization, its programs remain intact and are administered by other units within the \nUSDA, such as the FSA. \n \nFarm Service Agency \n \nFarm lending by the FSA is probably the most familiar of the government loan programs in \nrural areas. FSA guaranteed loans are direct obligations of the U.S. government. The FSA \noperates numerous offices and administers the USDA\u2019s commodity income and price support \nprograms, farm credit programs, marketing programs, and federal crop insurance programs. \nFSA loans serve as the federal government\u2019s primary credit safety net for Ag producers. To \nqualify for loans, an applicant must demonstrate sufficient farm training or farm experience \nand be a current or future operator of a family-size (or smaller) farm. \n \nThe FSA provides credit assistance to farmers through two mechanisms: loan guarantees and \ndirect loans. Direct loans are made and serviced directly by FSA staff, often at subsidized \ninterest rates and concessionary terms and collateral requirements.
