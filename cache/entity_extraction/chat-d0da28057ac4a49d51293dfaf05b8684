While a bank cannot control commodity prices or production levels, \nadherence to prudent lending standards may protect certain banks from material loss, even \nwhen a borrower\u2019s farm operation experiences significant stress. (Updated in version 1.3) \n \nBusiness Description \n \n(Section updated in version 1.3) \n \nAg products vary widely. Different types of Ag production involve different markets, \ngrowing cycles, exposure to climate and growing conditions (including weather), perils \n(including fire, flood, infestations, and predation), and infrastructure costs. Banks should \nunderwrite, administer, and manage Ag credits commensurate with the risks inherent in the \ntype of Ag product. \n \nMajor segments of the Ag industry include crop production, Ag real estate, Ag equipment, \nlivestock production (such as cow-calf and feedlots), dairy, meatpacking, transportation and \nstorage, fertilizer production and distribution, ethanol production, and seed production. \nBanks provide financing for a broad spectrum of Ag products\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
