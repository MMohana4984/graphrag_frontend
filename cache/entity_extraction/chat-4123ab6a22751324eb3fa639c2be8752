Moreover, each Ag enterprise presents unique technologies, \nrestrictions, and challenges for both the borrower and bank lender. \n \nThe traditional role of bank credit in the Ag industry has involved funding seasonal \nproduction and longer-term investments in land, buildings, equipment, and breeding stock. \nLoan repayment depends primarily on the successful production and marketing of Ag \nproducts, and secondarily on loan collateral. In some cases, income generated from work \nperformed outside the Ag industry (nonfarm income) or work performed for other farms (off-\nfarm income) may be available.
