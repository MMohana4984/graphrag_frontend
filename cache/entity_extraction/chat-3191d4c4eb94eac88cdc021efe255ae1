Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [Person,Organization,Location,Event,Date,Product,Financial Instrument,Quantity,Work of Art,Title,Currency,Facility,Role,Material,Technology,Vehicle,Law,Patent,Disease,Treatment]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Farmers can select the \npercentage of yield differential they will receive. Unit prices are based on the pre-planting \nprice per unit set in futures contracts. \n \nCrop hail insurance is another form of yield insurance available to provide coverage against \nloss to growing crops caused by hail. Depending on the crop insured, a crop hail policy may \nalso provide coverage for loss caused by fire, lightning, wind (when accompanied by hail), \nvandalism, or malicious mischief. The crop may also be insured while in transportation sand \nduring storage. \n \nBanks should be able to obtain information from borrowers regarding the type of insurance \nselected (i.e., whether yield or revenue), crop pricing options, coverage percentage, and \nwhether the borrower is in compliance with the terms of the contract.
