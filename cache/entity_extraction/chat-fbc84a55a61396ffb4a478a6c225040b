Banks with lending activities to borrowers in certain Ag \nenterprises can face increased reputation risk. For example, a bank may finance operations \ngenerating large amounts of animal waste that could potentially contaminate water sources or \ncause other ecosystem damage. Public perception and potential litigation may cast the bank, \nalong with the borrower, as an adversary to be held responsible for environmental cleanup. \nCosts relating to remediation of environmental contamination and potential liabilities may \nexceed the amount of the original loan. (Updated in version 1.3) \n \nIn addition, the bank can damage its reputation if it reduces the availability of farm credit or \nforecloses on farm collateral. Many Ag lenders do business in small, rural communities. \nConstructively working with borrowers often benefits the bank and the borrower. Lending \ndecisions that are not publicly perceived as favorable to the community may have a \nsignificant effect on the bank\u2019s Ag lending activities. For example, if the bank forecloses on \na family farm owned for generations, the community may negatively view the bank\u2019s \nforeclosure action even if the action was a prudent business decision. \nComptrollers Handbook agricultural lending\nVersion 1.4 \nIntroduction > Risk Management \nComptroller\u2019s Handbook \n10 \nAgricultural Lending \nRisk Management \n \nEach bank should identify, measure, monitor, and control risk by implementing\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
