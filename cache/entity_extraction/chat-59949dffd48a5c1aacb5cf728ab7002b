Interest rates are negotiated between the lender and the borrower but are not to exceed \nthe average rate the lender offers its farm customers. This requirement and the government\u2019s \nassumption of risk provide borrowers with more favorable rates than the borrower may be \nable to obtain without a guarantee.

The lender makes the loan \nand services it to conclusion. If successful, the borrower is able to repay the loan and no \ntaxpayer money is used except for administrative expenses.
