Unanticipated costs may also require \nadditional short-term credit to maintain production levels (e.g., poor seed emergence \nresulting from excessive rainfall can require replanting). In such circumstances, the borrower \ncomes under increased pressure to generate sufficient cash flow to cover the higher operating \ncosts and repay the operating line. Alternatively, the borrower may purposely carry short-\nterm production credit beyond the current growing cycle to store grain or defer sales in \nanticipation of higher market prices. \n \nFor crop and livestock operations with short production cycles, such as grains or feeder \ncattle, the loans may be structured to be annually repaid and renewed. For crops involving \nlong growing cycles, such as timber or aquaculture, a level of principal amortization is \ngenerally required well before maturity. The outstanding balance of the loan should fluctuate \nwith the cash needs of the borrower, subject to the availability constraints of established \nfinancial covenants or other controls within the loan agreement. \n \nMedium-term loans: Medium-term operating loans may be up to three years in length and \ntypically involve secured real estate as additional collateral.
