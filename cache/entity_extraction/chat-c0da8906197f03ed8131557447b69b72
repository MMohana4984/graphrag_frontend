For example, the Agricultural Act of \n2014 (\u201cFarm Bill\u201d) eliminated direct payments to Ag producers while continuing crop \ninsurance options, rural development programs, and conservation programs. Further, the \nFarm Bill eliminated some tax subsidies for corn ethanol producers. \n \nLimited Purpose Collateral \n \nThe limited purpose of some Ag-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral \nmay have limited or no other uses to support values when loan repayment problems emerge. \nFor example, a broiler barn may have little residual value if a poultry grower loses a \nprocessing contract. Additionally, commodity prices and land values are highly correlated, \nespecially in Ag regions where farmland has no other use. Conversely, regions with multiple \nuses for land may have minimal correlation between land values and commodity prices. \n \nInterest Rate Risk\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
