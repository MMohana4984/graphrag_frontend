Some guarantees may be limited in nature, such \nas covering interest only or partial principal, and may be limited to a specific time frame or \ncrop production cycle. \n \nRisk Mitigation \n \nAg borrowers are subject to fluctuating market prices, extreme weather conditions, and other \nperils that can jeopardize repayment. As a result, various tools are often used to mitigate risk. \n \nGovernment programs: Various government programs may limit the risk of farming. As an \nexample, by entering cropland into the Conservation Reserve Program, farmers contractually \ncommit to eliminate crop production on that land. The farmer receives annual payments \nestablished by bid at the inception of the contract, which typically runs five to 10 years. \nAdditionally, when available, federal government price supports for certain crops provide \ncommodity price risk mitigation to both the Ag borrower and the bank. \n \nCrop insurance: Borrowers purchase crop insurance to protect themselves against either the \nloss of crops caused by natural disasters such as hail, drought, and floods or the loss of \nrevenue caused by declines in prices of Ag commodities. These two general categories of \ncrop insurance are called crop yield insurance and crop revenue insurance. \n \nRevenue-based crop insurance policies compensate farmers for shortfalls in crop revenues \nrelative to their baseline averages and may also allow for increased payments if harvest \nprices\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
