From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

For example, the bank may segment \nits Ag portfolio by collateral type, geographic market, crop or livestock type, dryland or \nirrigated farming, whether operated by tenant or owner, and risk rating. Other useful \nstratifications may include loan structure, loan purpose, loan-to-value, debt service coverage, \npolicy exceptions on newly underwritten credit facilities, and affiliated loans. Because of \ncorrelations among Ag-related risk factors, stress testing can be an important part of the \nbank\u2019s risk management process. Further guidance is contained in the \u201cConcentrations of \nCredit\u201d booklet of the Comptroller\u2019s Handbook. \n \nEnvironmental Issues \n \n(Section updated in version 1.3) \n \nEnvironmental contamination may negatively affect the value of real property collateral as \nwell as create potential liability for a bank under various environmental laws. Ag loans \nsecured by real property may expose the bank to environmentally related risks. Additionally, \nsome Ag industries are more highly regulated for environmental contamination (see the \n\u201cCompliance\u201d and \u201cReputation Risk\u201d sections of this booklet for details and examples). \nTherefore, the bank\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
