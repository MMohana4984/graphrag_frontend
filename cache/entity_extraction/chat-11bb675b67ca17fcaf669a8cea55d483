Additionally, \nsome Ag industries are more highly regulated for environmental contamination (see the \n\u201cCompliance\u201d and \u201cReputation Risk\u201d sections of this booklet for details and examples). \nTherefore, the bank\u2019s Ag loan policy should establish a program for assessing the potential \nadverse effect of environmental contamination and include appropriate controls to limit the \nbank\u2019s exposure to environmental liability associated with real estate collateral. \n \nIf determined to be a responsible party or owner of repossessed property after foreclosure, \nthe bank may be held financially responsible for environmental remediation under provisions \nof the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \n(42 USC 9601 et seq.). Further, significant environmental disasters can severely increase \nreputation risk for responsible parties\u2014including a bank financing Ag lending. As a result, \npotential liabilities can greatly exceed the amount of the original loan.
