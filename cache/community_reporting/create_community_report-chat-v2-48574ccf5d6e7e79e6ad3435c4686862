The Borrower receives funds from lenders and is tasked with preparing compliance certificates and managing their financial capacity. Their creditworthiness and financial condition are evaluated, including their historical performance in managing debt obligations and their farming or ranching experience if applicable. \n\nThe Borrower may face challenges in generating sufficient income to repay the debt and must meet specific requirements for underwriting and collateral, especially if the loan is for planting purposes. Their risk profile influences how their inventory is managed, and they are subject to financial covenants and other controls within the loan agreement. Lenders monitor the Borrower's financial condition and operations to ensure compliance and assess the risk and supervisory treatment of the loan. \n\nThe Borrower must provide collateral and maintain ownership rights, benefiting from favorable interest rates due to guarantees and interest rate subsidies from entities like the FSA. They must also meet minimum standards for debt service, net worth, liquidity, and leverage. Overall, the Borrower's financial capacity to service and amortize the debt is under continuous examination by the lenders.\",24\r\n261,\"\"\"COLLATERAL\"\"\",\"\"\"Collateral\"\" refers to assets that a borrower offers to a lender to secure a loan. These assets can include a wide range of property or commodities such as real estate, machinery, equipment, stored crops, livestock, and even breeding or dairy livestock. The primary function of collateral is to provide security for the loan, ensuring that the lender has a means to recover the loan amount if the borrower defaults. \n\nIf the borrower fails to repay the loan, the collateral can be seized, repossessed, foreclosed upon, or liquidated by the lender to cover the outstanding debt. The value of the collateral can change over time and is subject to valuation and monitoring. For agricultural loans, specific requirements and valuations may apply, including current crop and livestock inspections, equipment valuations, and real estate appraisals. \n\nAdditionally, the collateral must have a current market value of at least 100 percent of the loan amount exceeding the bank's 15 percent general limit. Collateral not only supports the loan by providing cash flow and value but is also considered in the evaluation of the loan's risk rating.\",24\r\n521,\"\"\"LOAN\"\"\",\"A loan is a financial instrument where a bank provides funds to a borrower, which must be repaid with interest over a specified period. This financial arrangement involves borrowing money with the agreement to repay it, typically with interest, under specific conditions. Loans are subject to lending limits and often require collateral, such as staples, to secure the borrowed amount.\",14\r\n424,\"\"\"LIEN\"\"\",\"A Lien is a legal right or interest that a lender, such as a bank or an individual, has in the borrower's property. This right is granted until the debt obligation is satisfied. Specifically, in the context of livestock, a lien ensures the lender's security interest in the livestock used as collateral for a loan. This means that the lender retains a legal claim over the livestock until the borrower discharges the debt owed.\",6\r\n355,\"\"\"REAL ESTATE\"\"\",\"Real Estate is a significant asset on a farmer\u2019s or rancher\u2019s balance sheet, subject to price volatility and production variability. It refers to property that can be used as collateral for securing medium-term operating loans and is typically amortized over a period of up to 30 years. Additionally, the property proposed as collateral may have associated environmental hazards.\",4\r\n73,\"\"\"CARRYOVER DEBT\"\"\",\"Carryover Debt is a type of debt that remains unpaid from one operating cycle to the next, indicating a potential credit weakness. It refers to existing debt that is carried over into a new loan period, often because the borrower is unable to generate sufficient income to repay the debt within the original term. This unpaid amount is typically restructured into a longer-term loan. Carryover Debt needs to be analyzed in relation to the borrower's operation size, cash flow, liquidity, and leverage. In the context of agricultural operations, it specifically refers to the portion of an agricultural operating line that the borrower cannot repay from operating production revenue. This debt acts as a substitute for investment capital and should be serviced through future cash flow, the sale of unencumbered assets, or other sources.\",10\r\n62,\"\"\"MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT\"\"\",\"\"\"Machinery and Equipment\"\" are significant assets on a farmer\u2019s or rancher\u2019s balance sheet, subject to depreciation, especially if used excessively or under harsh conditions. These refer to the tools and machines used in agricultural production and operations, which can be used as collateral for loans and are evaluated in the context of agricultural lending. As capital assets, machinery and equipment are typically amortized over five to seven years.\",4\r\n359,\"\"\"RISK RATING\"\"\",\"\"\"Risk Rating\"\" is the process of assigning a rating to a loan based on its risk level, which helps in managing and mitigating risks. It refers to the assessment of the risk associated with carryover debt, providing more information on the borrower's financial stability. Additionally, risk rating is a system used to assess the risk associated with a borrower\u2019s debt exposure and repayment capacity.\",3\r\n518,\"\"\"GUARANTORS\"\"\",\"Guarantors are financially responsible individuals or entities that provide support for a loan, enhancing its creditworthiness. They agree to repay the loan if the borrower defaults, thereby adding strength to the loan's security. Guarantors serve as secondary sources of repayment for loans, and their capacity and willingness to repay are evaluated if the borrower's financial condition warrants concern.\",5\r\n320,\"\"\"CASH FLOW\"\"\",\"\"\"CASH FLOW\"\" is a financial metric analyzed for large farms such as livestock operations. It refers to the movement of money into and out of a business, which is crucial for covering operating costs and repaying loans. Specifically, cash flow denotes the net amount of cash being transferred into and out of a business, particularly from operations, and serves as the primary source of repayment for loans. Additionally, cash flow impacts the liquidity of a business by reflecting the total amount of money being transferred.\",6\r\n472,\"\"\"LENDING BANK\"\"\",\"The Lending Bank is the financial institution responsible for verifying the location, amount, and condition of harvested or finished crops, as well as inspecting breeding stock and livestock.\",7\r\n57,\"\"\"FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\"\"\",\"\"\"Financial Analysis\"\" involves a thorough understanding of the borrower's operating environment and cash flow, which is crucial for lenders to assess the borrower's financial health and repayment capacity.
