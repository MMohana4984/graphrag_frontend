These loans are specifically designed to support agricultural purposes, including the planting, harvesting, and marketing of crops, as well as the raising and feeding of livestock. The repayment of Ag Loans is highly dependent on the successful execution of these agricultural activities.\n\nAg Loans are subject to a variety of risks, including those related to weather, disease, pests, and environmental contamination. They require careful risk management and monitoring, with specific underwriting practices to assess the borrower's financial condition, loan performance, and collateral value. These loans are typically classified as commercial loans and are subject to regulatory limits and conditions.\n\nThe evaluation of Ag Loans involves assessing the borrower's worth, debt service capacity, and the underlying collateral, which often includes agricultural real property. These loans are also subject to refinancing, renewal, and environmental evaluations, with varying levels of risk and quality. Banks must identify, monitor, manage, and stress test these loans to ensure their stability and performance.\n\nIn some cases, Ag Loans may have structural weaknesses and underwriting exceptions, and they can be re-booked if previously charged-off. The levels of outstanding Ag Loans are compared relative to the bank's capital, and they are evaluated for possible classification based on the borrower's financial condition and loan performance.
