The Borrower receives funds from lenders and is tasked with preparing compliance certificates and managing their financial capacity. Their creditworthiness and financial condition are evaluated, including their historical performance in managing debt obligations and their farming or ranching experience if applicable. \n\nThe Borrower may face challenges in generating sufficient income to repay the debt and must meet specific requirements for underwriting and collateral, especially if the loan is for planting purposes. Their risk profile influences how their inventory is managed, and they are subject to financial covenants and other controls within the loan agreement. Lenders monitor the Borrower's financial condition and operations to ensure compliance and assess the risk and supervisory treatment of the loan. \n\nThe Borrower must provide collateral and maintain ownership rights, benefiting from favorable interest rates due to guarantees and interest rate subsidies from entities like the FSA. They must also meet minimum standards for debt service, net worth, liquidity, and leverage. Overall, the Borrower's financial capacity to service and amortize the debt is under continuous examination by the lenders.\",24\r\n261,\"\"\"COLLATERAL\"\"\",\"\"\"Collateral\"\" refers to assets that a borrower offers to a lender to secure a loan. These assets can include a wide range of property or commodities such as real estate, machinery, equipment, stored crops, livestock, and even breeding or dairy livestock. The primary function of collateral is to provide security for the loan, ensuring that the lender has a means to recover the loan amount if the borrower defaults. \n\nIf the borrower fails to repay the loan, the collateral can be seized, repossessed, foreclosed upon, or liquidated by the lender to cover the outstanding debt. The value of the collateral can change over time and is subject to valuation and monitoring. For agricultural loans, specific requirements and valuations may apply, including current crop and livestock inspections, equipment valuations, and real estate appraisals. \n\nAdditionally, the collateral must have a current market value of at least 100 percent of the loan amount exceeding the bank's 15 percent general limit.
