The Environmental Risk Management Program is a crucial aspect of their risk management strategy, helping to mitigate potential liabilities related to environmental issues. This program is part of the broader regulatory framework that ensures the financial stability and risk management of these institutions [Data: Entities (5, 405); Relationships (93)].\"\r\n\n\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n329,\"\"\"EXAMINERS\"\"\",\"Examiners are individuals responsible for a wide range of critical financial assessment and verification tasks. They analyze carryover debt and determine appropriate classifications and ratings, assess the likelihood that a loan should be passed or criticized based on various financial and performance criteria, and evaluate the quantity of credit risk in agricultural lending activities using the Comptroller\u2019s Handbook. Additionally, examiners evaluate the repayment capacity and risk rating of agricultural loans, including the analysis of carryover debt. They review and assess the bank's commercial lending policies and practices, determine loan classifications and credit risk ratings, and exercise reasonable judgment in the absence of adequate analysis and documentation. Furthermore, examiners perform verification procedures to ensure the reliability of financial records and the existence of assets and liabilities, and they support various assessment modules in Examiner View.\",15\r\n217,\"\"\"CARRYOVER DEBT\"\"\",\"\"\"Carryover Debt\"\" is a type of debt that remains unpaid from one operating cycle to the next, indicating a potential credit weakness. It specifically refers to the portion of an agricultural operating line that the borrower cannot repay from operating production revenue. This type of debt represents a substitute for investment capital and should be serviced through future cash flow, the sale of unencumbered assets, or other sources. Carryover debt typically arises due to the borrower's inability to generate sufficient income to repay the debt, often resulting in the debt being restructured into a longer-term loan.
