Farmers often take out loans for various agricultural activities and may potentially have carryover debt.\n\nTo mitigate risks, farmers can select different types of insurance policies to protect against yield shortfalls and other risks. They purchase crop insurance to safeguard against yield or revenue shortfalls, choosing the percentage of historical coverage or yield differential they want.
