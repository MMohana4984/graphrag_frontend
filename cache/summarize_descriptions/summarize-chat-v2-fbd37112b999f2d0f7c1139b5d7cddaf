{"result": "Carryover Debt is a type of debt that remains unpaid from one operating cycle to the next, indicating a potential credit weakness. It refers to existing debt that is carried over into a new loan period, often because the borrower is unable to generate sufficient income to repay the debt within the original term. This unpaid amount is typically restructured into a longer-term loan. Carryover Debt needs to be analyzed in relation to the borrower's operation size, cash flow, liquidity, and leverage. In the context of agricultural operations, it specifically refers to the portion of an agricultural operating line that the borrower cannot repay from operating production revenue. This debt acts as a substitute for investment capital and should be serviced through future cash flow, the sale of unencumbered assets, or other sources.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
