{"result": "The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) is a financial reserve used by banks to cover potential losses on loans and leases. This process involves segmenting agricultural loans with similar characteristics for analysis, especially when there is a significant concentration, to manage potential losses.
