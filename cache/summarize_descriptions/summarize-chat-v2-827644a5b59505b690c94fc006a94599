{"result": "The \"BOARD\" is an organization responsible for establishing limits and monitoring performance in relation to loan policy exceptions. They provide oversight for the Ag lending function, influencing the quality of decision-making. Annually, the Board reviews and approves Ag lending policies and receives risk analysis from bank management. They are expected to have knowledge of key risk factors in Ag lending specific to the bank and oversee management's implementation of control systems in Ag lending policies. The Board is responsible for providing oversight and governance within a bank, ensuring effective controls and risk management. They receive appropriate reports to analyze the effect of Ag activities on the bank's credit risk profile, but may not be receiving sufficient information due to deficiencies in MIS. To further assess credit risk and risk management processes in Ag lending, the Board should establish independent audit and loan review functions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
