It specifically refers to the portion of an agricultural operating line that the borrower cannot repay from operating production revenue. This type of debt represents a substitute for investment capital and should be serviced through future cash flow, the sale of unencumbered assets, or other sources. Carryover debt typically arises due to the borrower's inability to generate sufficient income to repay the debt, often resulting in the debt being restructured into a longer-term loan.
