{"result": "Livestock are significant assets on a farmer\u2019s or rancher\u2019s balance sheet, subject to price volatility and production variability. This category includes a variety of animals such as dairy and beef cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, horses, mules, poultry, and fish, whether or not they are held for resale. Livestock encompasses animals raised and fed to market weight or offspring from reproduction, which are typically under the borrower's control for less than one year and require inspection and appraisal. These animals are raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as meat, milk, leather, and wool. Livestock can be used as collateral for securing agricultural loans or an operating line of credit, contributing to the repayment of these loans.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
