{"result": "Bt Corn is a type of corn that has received a gene from a naturally occurring soil bacterium called Bacillus Thuringiensis. This gene enables the corn plant to produce insecticidal compounds known as Bt toxins, which protect it from certain insects, particularly the European corn borer. The Bt toxins affect the midgut of these insects, providing the corn with a natural defense mechanism against pest damage.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
