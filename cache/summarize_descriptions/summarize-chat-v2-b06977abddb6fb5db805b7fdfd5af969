{"result": "A Lien is a legal right or interest that a lender, such as a bank or an individual, has in the borrower's property. This right is granted until the debt obligation is satisfied. Specifically, in the context of livestock, a lien ensures the lender's security interest in the livestock used as collateral for a loan.
