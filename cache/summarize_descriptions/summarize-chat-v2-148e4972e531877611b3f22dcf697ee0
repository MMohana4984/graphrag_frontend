{"result": "\"Ag Lending\" refers to the practice of providing loans and financial services specifically tailored for the agricultural sector. This type of lending is critical for many banks, especially in rural areas, as it supports farm activities, new technologies, and techniques. Ag Lending can be a significant source of income and risk for banks, involving various types of risks such as credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, price, compliance, strategic, reputation, and environmental risks. \n\nThe process of Ag Lending includes extensive documentation and monitoring to mitigate these risks and ensure compliance with specific statutes and regulations, such as those described in 12 CFR 32.3.
