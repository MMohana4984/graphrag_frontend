{"result": "Operational Risk refers to the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events. In the context of agricultural lending (Ag lending), this encompasses the risk of loss due to these same factors. Specifically, it includes the risk to a bank's financial condition and resilience arising from human errors, misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational Risk highlights the importance of robust internal procedures, systems, and policies within an organization to mitigate potential losses.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
